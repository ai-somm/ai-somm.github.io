title: Somm Into the Model

<div class="blurb">
	<p>Welcome to Somm Into the Model! Site Under Construction - coming attractions!</p>

	<!--<h5>Thank you for stopping by my website!</h5>
	<h5>I am a fifth-year PhD student at the Johnson School of Cornell University, majoring in Management with foci on Information Management and Marketing, minoring in Computer Science and Statistics.</h5>
	<h5>With years of training and research experience in multiple disciplines spanning experimental/behavioral economics, applied statistics, machine learning (computer vision & 
		natural language processing), marketing, and operations management, I am lucky enough to have published (as first/solo/second authors) in top journals and conferences in natural language processing, computer vision, and applied statistics, and given the opportunities to give talks and chair sessions at major conferences in operations research, business, quantitative marketing, natural language processing, and computer vision. </h5>
	<h5>My dissertation "Information Design with Big Data" can be summarized as solving business problems and providing managerial insights with machine learning (language and vision) methods and big data. 
		For instance, my first chapter combines behavioral economics, information theory, and text mining to study storytelling in movies. My second chapter combines cognitive psychology, information theory, experimental design, and computer vision techniques to study memorability and likability of visual designs at a large scale. </h5>
		
		My third chapter provides the first and extensive review of the intersection of computer vision and marketing, identifying overlaps and gaps in-between, and therefore pinpointing a myriad of exciting opportunities onward.</h5>
	<h5>I am also a certified sommelier, and certified specialist of wine and spirits, with WSET diploma in progress. I have been writing a book "Somm: Into the Model" that combines data science and wines & vines.</h5>
	
	
	I recently graduated from Cornell University with a PhD in Information Management.<br>
	My doctoral dissertation is about Information Design with Big Data.<br>
	I will start working as a Research Scientist in New York City at Dataminr, a startup that focuses on information discovery in real time.

	<p> Bio </p>
	Shengli Hu received her PhD from Cornell University in 2019, and has since been an AI research scientist with Dataminr Inc. in New York City. Her research experience and interests
lie in intersdisciplinary research bridging social sciences, computational linguistics, computer vision, and speech. She has published in top conferences and journals in natural language
processing, computer vision, speech, and applied statistics including Association of Computational
Linguistics (ACL), Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), European
Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), InterSpeech, and Annals of Applied Statistics (AoAS).<br>
	<br>
She is also a wine professional with credentials including Certified Sommelier by The Court
of Master Sommelier, Diploma in Wine (aka level 4 - the top level) by Wine and Spirits Education Trust (WSET), Certified Specialist of Wine by The Society of Wine Educators, and Certified Specialist of Spirits by 
	The Society of Wine Educators. <!--She is working towards Master of Wine.
