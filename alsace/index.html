<h3 style="color:fuchsia;" name="winetalk">Trip Report</h4>
<h4 style="color:orange"><a href="#alsace">Alsace</a> | <a href="#baden">Baden</a> | <a href="#pfalz">Pfalz</a></h4> 

<p>We made our cross-Atlantic trip to Alsace in December 2022, with clear intentions of visiting as many domaines in Alsace as we could, wandering around some Christmas markets, and perhaps hitting some weinguts in Baden and Pfalz in passing.</p>

<p>We flew Lufthansa from SFO to FRA and took the Lufthansa express bus down to Strasbourg. The next morning we rented a car and started driving south and visiting domaines along the way. We stayed in Ribeauville for six nights as our base for winery visits in Alsace and Baden. We then drove up to Deidesheim as our base for winery visits in Pfalz.</p>

<h5 style="color:pink">Lessons Learnt - Trip Logistics</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Almost all Alsacien wineries require reservations in advance. How far in advance depends on its popularity. For example, Zind-Humbrecht requires 6-8 weeks in advance, and as does Domaine Weinbach. But most other wineries can be scheduled with a few days' or just one day's notice.</li>
  <li>Many Pfalz wineries with tasting rooms welcome walk-ins and do not take reservations. Smaller wineries do require reservations like Alsacien wineries, but most can be scheduled promptly.</li>
  <li>Wine suitcase (mine is VinGardeValise bought at $369) is probably the best solution so far for taking a case or two back home (to US) with us. Haus Packs (inflatable air columns as cushioning) with air pumps are the best wine sleeves for wrapping small numbers of bottles.</li>
  <li>Direct shipping with Cote d'Or Imports (with which Marcel Deiss works) or MBE (with which Marc Tempe works) turns out to be our choice for shipping cases of wines back home. A case runs about $190 but you don't have to pay taxes (which you would pay if you were to go with wine suitcases as checked luggage.).</li>
  <li>Tasting at five domaines per day sounds ambitious but is totally feasible if planned meticulously :)</li>
  <li>DO make dinner reservations for restaurants! Restaurants open at very restricted hours and are always fully booked. We learnt it the hard way.</li>
</ul>
<h5 style="color:pink">Lessons Learnt - Wine Study</h5>

<ul>
   <li> Many Alsacien producers have been experimenting Syrah or Shiraz in light of global warming with encouraging results. None released yet, but may well be in a few years.</li>
   <li> Almost every Alsacien producer makes skin contact (orange) wines off Pinot Gris or Gewurztraminer.</li>
   <li> Alsace, Pfalz, and Baden have been the overlooked, underrated, and best value premier Pinor Noir producing regions for quite a while now.</li>
   <li> Klevener de Heiligenstein: pink-skinned Savagnin Rose variety that's been planted and vinified by very few domaines left. Usually with some skin-contact or in an oxidative style.</li>
   <li> Pinot Blanc and Auxerrois: as is well known these two are usually blended. One could make a 100% Auxerrois cuvee and label it as Pinot Blanc, but not the other way around (though nor would anyone do such thing...).</li>
   <li> After this trip of 28 wineries (domaines, weinguts) tasting through a few hundreds of wines including various expressions of the same grand cru sites, I finally got a hang of how to taste soil types or lieux-dix in wines... the crushed wet stone kinda minerality in Rangen, the salty minerality in Schlossberg, and the tension and smoke in Kastelberg...</li>
   <li> All the Alsacien producers we tasted at swear by selection massal off Burgundy scions offered by local nurseries, and are under constant stress of mildews, frosts, and esca pressures with nepoviruses also an issue in Pfalz, whereas Pfalz and Baden producers we tasted at use a mix of German clones and Burgundy clones like Dijon for Pinot Noir.</li>
   <li> Being the mosaic landscape of soil compositions in Alsace, every grand cru (now 51, soon to be 53) is unique in its own way. However, sandstone appears to be everywhere, volcanic soils appears to be the most characterful and distinctive in terms of manifestation in wines, such as Rangen (volcanic) and Kastelberg (slate). And the same, I'd argue, goes with Forst (volcanic) in Pfalz.</li>
  <li> Two new grand cru sites just got approved on May 13, 2022 for Pinot Noir: Kirchsberg de Barr (limestone), Hengst (limestone-marl). They will go into effect in 2023.</li>
  <li> We learnt about various changes happeninng at different domaines to hedge against global warming: from starting to blend warmer sites with cooler sites (Bechtold) to experimenting with alternative grape varieties such as Syrah and Shiraz (JosMeyer, Bott-Geyl, Meyer Fonne, etc.), from using coal as compost material to increase soil water holding capacity (Koehler-Ruprecht) to pushing for biodynamic and/or regenerative viticulture to improve the resilience of vines (Lissner, Bechtold, Zind-Humbrecht, Schoffit, etc. too many.), from experimenting with echalas for vine training (Marc Kreydenweiss) to tailoring Poulssard, simple or double Guyot for each vine (JosMeyer, Weinbach, etc.). Global warming is clearly on every grower's mind and everyone is actively seeking solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h5 style="color:pink">Domaines we missed and would definitely like to visit next time around:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Leon Beyer</li>
<li>Domaine Mure</li>

<h4 style="color:orange" name="alsace">Alsace</h4>

<h5 style="color:coral">Marlenheim</h5>

<h5 style="color:red" href="http://bechtold.alsace/">Domaine Bechtold</h5>
<ul>
<li>Organic and biodynamic since QQQ. The Bechtold family in the neat little town of Marleheim 20 minutes west of Strasbourg, vinifies Riesling, Muscat, Gewurztraminer, and Cremant in stainless steel tanks and Pinor Noir, Pinot Meunier in 4th fill pieces from Burgundy. As part of Neal Rosenthal's portfolio, they are visited by Neal every January, when Neal tastes all the current releases and decides on which ones and how many to import. So far, Neal has only been taking dry wines from them. One interesting bit about how Neal took skin-contact Gewurztraminer: when he tasted it, he was really impressed but had to seek confirmation so he called Jeremy immediately and got off the phone with a 900-bottle deal.</li>
<li>The tasting room is clearly just a room in their family home retrofitted to include a tasting counter. The house cat -- a tripod orange tabby GIRL with only one paw happily roamed around and greeted us. Marie QQQ warmly received us and she told us that her son QQQ has taken over the winemaking and is vacationing to return around Xmas. Interestingly at our tasting at Marc Kreydenweiss that followed immediately after, we learnt that QQQ interned with Marc Kreydenweiss and the two domaines have been very close with one another.</li>
<li>Vintage 2018 was a great year with a dry spring, and really nice weathers during summer -- dry, and not too hot.</li>
<li>Vintage 2020 was a hot year, leading to aromatic whites at the domaine.</li>
<li>Vintage 2021 was a rather difficult vintage. It was raining all summer, which led to lots of mildews. The family tried their best to keep mildrews under control but still lost 40% yield, which has never happened in the past 40 years. To combat mildews, they resorted to the biodynamic measures: using sting nettles, prele??, picking when the sap flow is at the lowest, spraying tea essence, and the cream of grass and tea, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:orange">♥ Riesling Sussenberg 2018</span>: Petrol, chalky minerality, apricot, Meyer lemon. Fruit-wrapped high acidity. Long creamy finish. 32-year-old vines on limestone just under GC Engelberg. 2018 will be the last vintage of this wine as the site is getting warmer with climate change. Therefore starting 2020, this lieu-dit will be blended with another cooler lieu-dit Silbersberg.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Riesling Le Nef 2020</span>: Lemon oil, Meyer lemon, peach blossom, chalky minerality. High acidity and medium plus finish. The parcel dates back from 1405 and the label is inspired from the Noah's Ark. </li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Riesling GC Engelberg 2020</span>: Hefty aromatics of white flowers, citrus zest, lemon blossom, minerality. High acidity and long finish on minerality.</li>

Medium plus acidity and finish. Half destemmed and half whole cluster. Pigeage for 2-3 days, remontage every day for two weeks, then slow and long press with pneumatic press to avoid astringency from stems. Then put into 4th-fill barriques.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Gewurztraminer 2018 (VT)</span>: Not made every year. Usually harvested at the end of October, more than one month earlier than the normal 50 years ago, when harvested usually started in December. Mineral water, musk, allspices, orange juice. Medium plus acidity, medium finish.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Gewurztraminer GC Engelberg 2018</span>: Smoke! Allspices! Curry spices, lychee & lychee leaf, minerality. Sweet.

</ol>

<h5 style="color:coral">Andlau</h5>
<h5 style="color:red" href="http://www.kreydenweiss.com/alsace/10/18/the-winery/">Marc Kreydenweiss</h5>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps best known for their GC Kastelberg bottling on the powerful black schist soils. Marc Kreydenweiss was helmed by the Marc family since 1984. Low yielding, low intervention in celler, and focused on terrior expressions, 1985 marked the full conversion to biodynamic viticulture. In 1990, the family purchased the Wuhenry QQQ in Languedoc, which is now managed by Jean. In 2007, Antoine took over winemaking in the Alsace/Andlau domaine. All wines in Alsace are vinified in the traditional foudres, and all wines in Languedoc are vinified in stainless steel and concrete tanks.</li>
<li>A small experimental plot of vines are trained high on single stalk (echalas), like those commonly seen in northern Rhone.</li>
<li>Their Pinot Noir is made with short maceration, no new oak, no cold soak, 100% whole cluster, with destemming only used in difficult vintages.</li>
<li>Vintage 2020 was warm and dry with healthy fruit thus easy harvest. Wines have the profile of cooler vintages such as 2019 but with even better freshness. Harvest usually starts early mid September, and lasts until early to mid October.</li>
<li>Each year an artist is commissioned to create label arts.</li>
<li>Two US importers: AP Imports and Williams Connor Wine in Virginia.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:orange">Brut Nature - Lune a Boire (moon to drink) NV</span>: Two years aging on lees. Minerality, toast, creme fraiche, salinity. Creamy and salty. Medium plus acidity and finish.</li>

Pale straw, honey, apricot, honeysuckle. Smells very sweet on the nose (slightly petrol?) Zingy high acidity, medium plus finishes on tartness.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Au Dessus de la Loi</span>: On pink sandstone typical of northern Alsace, which makes a wine floral. Petrol, ripe citrus - Meyer lemon oil, lemon blossom, minerality. High acidity, medium plus/long finish on citrus and minerality.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">La Fontaine 2017</span>: North-facing late-ripening Riesling vines planted at high altitute in a cool microclimate, on granite soils that give wines an airy texture. Fresh lemon oil and lemon blossom, herbal jasmine tea. Medium acidity, medium plus finish with more fruit presence and less tart.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Clos du Val d'Eleon 2018</span>: Cool site in a warmer vintage on blue schist (slate as in Mosel, which is rare in Alsace). Slaty minerality, precision, high acidity, medium plus finish, 13% abv. Riesling and Pinot Gris coplanted and cofermented.</li>

</ol>
<h5 style="color:coral">Ribeauville</h5>
This is the base we picked for our stay. Next to Maison Trimbach, surrounded by GCs Osterberg and Geisberg, the blend of which goes into Trimbach Cuvee Frederic Emile.

<h5 style="color:red" href="">Kientzler</h5>
<ul>
<li>Kientzler makes such beautifully terrior-focused wines. On their labels, only grand cru terriors are featured whereas grape varieties fade into the background as a tiny letter print. For instance, an R enclosed by a minimalist square represents Riesling, as does G Gewurztraminer, or M Muscat, etc. All stainless steel vinification to let the terrior shine. All wines are bottled the year after, and released after years aged in bottle. This is one of the domaines that showcases soils and terriors the most crystal clear. Their Riesling GC Kirchberg smells and tastes much more similar to their Muscat or Pinot Gris GC Kirchberg than their Riesling GC Geisberg or lieu-dit Muhlfost. </li>
<li>Vintage 2019 resulted in more concentrated wines at low yield at 40 hl/ha.</li>
<li>Geisberg is a very challenging terrior featuring very steep slopes on limestone and sandstone. Odium, esca, and mildews are common threats, and trunks are renewed (recépage) to combat these fungal disease.  Kientzler produces 3000-6000 bottles every vintage. Compared to Muscat (messier cluster than Riesling), Riesling clusters are tighter.</li>
<li>50% exported. 30 hectares that come out between 50k and 70k bottles per vintage. US importer: AP Imports.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:orange">Muscat GC Kirchberg 2017</span>: Cool climate, 200 meters left of the tasting room (the house). Southwest facing, 65-66 years old vines on marl sandstone. Kirchberg means mountain of church. Stainless steel vinification. Bone dry with 1g/L RS. This does not smell like your typical terpene-driven highly aromatically floral Muscat at all. Precisely steely minerality. Hints of fruits. Chalky texture. Muscat-sque fruit on the finish. Medium acidity and medium finish.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Riesling lieu-dit Muhlfost 2019</span>: South-facing gentle slopes of marl soils at lower elevation than Kirchberg with a warmer microclimate. Ripe citrus, pepper, minerality of white chalks, white flowers. High acidity, bone dry at 2g/L RS, medium plus finish on chalky minerality. 13.5%.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Geisberg Riesling 2018</span>: Steep slopes on limestone and sandstone. Candied lemon and lime, white flowers. Airy chalky and stony minerality. High acidity, medium plus finish on searing acidity.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Pinot Gris Kirchberg 2019</span>: Very similar to Muscat GC Kirchberg on the nose. More steely/metaly minerality. Lean salinity. Tart peach, sour lemon, tart pomaceous fruits. Medium acidity, medium plus finish on tartness and steely minerality.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Pinot Gris Reserve Particuliere 2018</span>: Riper fruit harvested from hillside. Green apple, white almond, ripe pomaceous fruits, chalky minerality. Off-dry with phenolic bitterness. 15g/L RS.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Gewurztraminer GC Osterberg 2018</span>: Fainted lychee on the nose. Sour lemon. Steely mineral water. Fresh mango. Sweet - 50g/L RS. Medium plus acidity and finish on lychee and minerality.</li>
</ol>
<h5 style="color:red" href="">Maison Trimbach</h5>
<ul>
<li>Vintage 17 - hot vintage (? I don't think so...) that resulted in ripe and healthy grapes.</li>
<li>Vintage 19 - cooler vintage.</li>
<li>Never produced any Riesling VT or SGN since 2001 because of global warming that resulted in vintages too hot and dry for Botrytis formation on Riesling. Vintage 2022 was very hot which resulted in ripe and healthy grapes but no Botrytis either.</li>
<li>2006 was a rainy and cool vintage.</li>
<li>2015 was sunny warm vintage in Alsace too.</li>
<li>In Alsace, Riesling makes up 20% of white wine production. At Trimbach, Riesling makes up 75% white wine production.</li>
<li>All vines are on double Guyot except Pinot Noir cuvee 7 which is on single Guyot to allow for more concentration, as Pinot Noir reserve vines are also on double Guyot.
<li>Harvest usually starts a minimum of two weeks after legal harvest date. 2022 vintage started early September, whereas the previous three years the harvest started early October. Less and less of this cuvee is getting produced, with AOC rules getting stricter. 90% wine production at Trimbach is dry.</li>
<li>92% exported, out of which 50% to US, more to HK, less to mainland China due to Covid restrictinos.</li>
</ul>

<ol>

Oldest vintage dates from 1717. 90% stainless steel and 10% old wooden vats for vinification. 2 g/L RS. 8 g/L acidity. Still quite closed in 2022. Faint white flowers, sweet chalky stone. Cuvee Frederic Emile was first produced in 1960s. Barack Obama drank this when he received the Nobel prize in peace in 2009. King of Sweden toasted birthdays with it too. 20k-30k bottles produced per vintage.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">♥ Clos St Hune 2015</span>: Gold in color. Petrol. Apricot, yellow peach, and tropical fruits such as mango. Chalky minerality. Very ripe fruit profile. Sweet at 24 g/L RS. Medium plus / medium+ acidity at 6 g/L acidity. Very Baroque on the palate.</li>

</ol>


<h5 style="color:coral">Zellenberg</h5>
<h5 style="color:red" href="">♥ Marc Tempe ♥</h5>
<ul>
<li>This is one of the tastings we will not forget. Marc Tempé is both a former lab technician and vineyard expert for the INAO. He helped select lieux-dits for possible inclusion in the AOC system. In 1993, Marc and his wife Anne-Marie took over his family’s domaine, re-establishing it as their own; they also inherited additional vineyard plots from both of their families. They completed conversion to full biodynamic farming in 1995. Upon entering, we were greeted by We were invited into a tasting room that is apparently the living room of the family house. Anne-Marie guided us through the tasting, with their dog biting her braided hair throughout :)
</li>
<li>Anne-Marie told us that their daughter owns the wine store La Sommeliere in Colmar, where we later went and met Mac, and where we obtained their wines and got them shipped back to the States.</li>
<li>2022 vintage was a very hot vintage, thus difficult as there was too much sunlight.</li>
<li>2019 was a warm and dry year, with no Botrytis.</li>
<li>In 2018, there was some Botrytis and fermentation stopped earlier even though weather was similar to 2019.</li>
<li>2021 vintage was opposite to 2022 with no sunshine, lots of rain that raised a lot of mildew pressure.</li>
<li>Most exported to Japan, and very little to US through distributor Vintage 59.</li>
<li>Before we left, Anne-Marie asked which domaines are we heading to next. We said it was gonna be Marcel Deiss. She immediately told us she thinks Marcel Deiss is one of the best domaines in Alsace and we would have a really nice tasting there.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:orange">♥ Roses Suavage 2019</span>: Half Pinot Noir and half Pinot Gris, harvested at around 30 hl/ha, spent over two years on lees, and no maceration. Pale salmon color. Salty and mineraly. Hints of peach, white strawberry. Medium plus acidity, long finish.</li>

</ol>

<h5 style="color:coral">Bergheim</h5>
<h5 style="color:red" href="">♥ Domaine Marcel Deiss ♥</h5>
<ul>
<li>Marcel Deiss needs no introduction. Best known for their coplanted ancient vines that go into co-fermented cuvees that put emphases on terrior expressions rather varietal characters. Vines ages range between 80-85 years old. Coplanted vines are all harvested at the same time. Massale selection in practice.</li>
<li>For instance, in Marcel Deiss's GC Altenberg plot, there are over 85 different varieties (of any color), at least 3-5 massale selected Riesling varieties. And their oldest vines are in GC Schoenenberg.</li> 
<li>Not all its neighbors buy such a philosophy. For instance, when we were visiting Domaine Weinbach the next day tasting their newest cuvee that is a blend of Pinot Gris and Gewurztraminer of their newly acquired parcels. Theo Faller specifically told us that they don't think the coplantation works well as different varieties ripen at different times and are suited to different terriors.</li>
<li>Vintage 2019 marks generous amount of sunshine that resulted in fruits with ripe acidity, and a healthy balance. </li>
<li>Vintage 2021 was the most complicated vintage in the last 50 years and Marcel Deiss also lost 60% yield to rains that caused mildews.</li>
<li>Mambourg - limestone that results in wide acidity; Schlossberg - granite that results in vertical wines; Altenberg - clay and limestone, also the only GC in Alsace that allows all 13 varieties; Schoenenerg - clay and gypse (gypsum); Zotzenberg is the only GC that allows Sylvaner; Hengst and Kirchberg de Barr are two GCs for Pinot Noir; Kaefferkopt allows 60-80% Gewurztraminer, 10-40% Riesling, <30% Pinot Gris, <10% Muscat.</li>
<li>Biodynamic since QQQ. They use pied de cuve for stuck fermentation.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:orange">Riquewihr (Schoenenbourg) 2020</span>: On clay soil that is commonly associated with fruiter expressions, as well as limestone. Southeast facing very gentle slopes around the village Riquewihr, a colder site. Over 13 varieties co-planted but the majority are Riesling and Pinot Gris. 14% abv.</li><li>Medium aromatic intensity. Pale straw with salmon hue. Sweet peach, white flowers, minerality, salinity, and apricot. Medium plus acidity, and medium plus finish on minerality and apricot.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Berckem (local name of Bergheim) 2019</span>: Colder and sunnier microclimate. Both southeast and southwest facing. Gold hue. Mostly Riesling and Pinot Gris. Very aromatic! Marigold, honeysuckle. Slightly off-dry. Medium acidity, 13.5% abv. Medium finish on marigold.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">♥ Langenberg 2019</span>: Pure granite. 3-4km from where the tasting room in Bergheim is. Some call it linear --- one knows exactly where it's heading. Pale straw.

<h5 style="color:coral">Beblenheim</h5>
<h5 style="color:red" href="">Bott-Geyl</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Created in 1775 by the marriage of familie Bott and familie Geyl. 99% production is white wines, with one red white and two sparkling wines. </li>
  <li>Produces from 6 varieties (Riesling, Muscat, Gewurztraminer, Pinot Noir, Pinot Blanc, Pinor Gris) and 6 grand cru sites (Schlossberg, Schonenberg, Mandelberg, Sporen, Furstentum, Snnenglanz).</li>
  <li>Biodynamic since 2000 - one of the first five growers to convert, along with Z-H, Marcel Deiss, Vicent Flheit.</li>
  <li>Long aging in bottle before release. For instance, current release of Pinot Gris GC is 2012. 90k bottles produced per year on average, but around 350k bottles are held in the cellar for extended aging.</li>
  <li>Vifinication is done partly in stainless steel tanks and foudres (half and half). Foudres at the domaine come in all sizes according to the size of the parcels. During the fermentation, vessels are swapped between stainless steel and used oak barrels to keep wines in balance. For instance, if the acidity is too high, the wine would be racked into foudres to round it out.</li>
  <li>Bott-Geyl aims to make wines of terrior and emotions. Organic and biodynamic farming is practiced. Natural sulphr or copper sprays are used for mildews. No chemical products used whatsoever. Sulphur usage is also limited --- a bit in tank after pressing before kicking off fermentation to prevent microbial spoilage.</li>
  <li>Has been experimenting with Syrah in the past few vintages, as Vin de France</li>

</ol>
<h5 style="color:red" href="">Pierre Sparr</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Cave de Beblenheim bought Pierre Sparr in 2009 when its quality was slipping and inconsistent. It wasn't unheard of: the Champagne brand Nicolas Feuillatte was bought by a co-op, which improved quality.  And since the Pierre Sparr purchase, a different Alsace co-op bought the bankrupt Lucien Albrecht winery and brought it back to life.</li>

This wine bar with over 200 wines by glass was recommended to us by Eric our host at Marcel Deiss. We headed over the next day when the snow started piling up... We had such a great time there despite having to drive back in pitch dark in the heavy snow... that we went back for a second time later that weekend after visiting Domaine Schoffit. Good times. Fantastic wine list. Will go back. Do make reservations.

The first time we went, we asked for an extensive flight showcasing Alsace Pinot Noirs, as well as a few old (like at least 80s or 90s) VT or SGNs. The resulting flights from the sommelier did not disappoint at all! Two wines were highlights: ♥ Leon Beyer Gewurztraminer SGN 1998 ♥ and ♥ Domaine Mure Clos Saint Landelin 2018 Pinot Noir ♥.

<ul>
  <li>Biodynamic since 2001, before which 3 years trial. Living soils, living wines.</li>
  <li>Sometimes fermentation lasts over a year (e.g. Riesling GC Steingrubler) due to the richness of the soil which gives rich wines. </li>
  <li>2017 there was lots of frosts that resulted in limited crop. So cuvee `4` was made to blend 4 grand crus Hengst, Rosenberg, Steingrubler, Pfersigberg. Only 900 bottles were produced. Annual total production is around 135k-150k bottles.</li>
  <li>2020 was very hot vintage.</li>
  <li>2021 was a very wet vintage. 40% crop loss due to mildew. Maximum amount and frequency of biodynamic preparation was applied every day at 4am...</li>
  <li>2022 was very hot too but no problem with the dryness because grass cover keeps the humidity.</li>
  <li>In total 18 hectares of 30-55 years' old vines, except young 5-year-old Pinot Blanc vines in Clos Sand, the soils worked by sheep. And they call the Pinot Blanc parcels in Rosenberg ``Fox Plots`` worked with sheep.</li>
  <li>Natural hazards include wild pigs who would eat grapes (less good) but they also help turn the soils.</li>
  <li>Massale selection.</li>
  <li>Pinot Noir vines in Hengst are 55 years old. Made into Pinot Noir Reserve. Whole cluster with 15 days of maceration then into used oak tanks.</li>

  </ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:orange">Cremant 2020</span>: 80% Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, Auxerrois and 20% Chardonnay. 9 months aging on lees. The same cremant in magnums 2012 was its current release after ten years' aging. Grapes were harvested fully ripe as if used for still wine. Fermentation in stainless steel, which was stopped by lowering temperature to start secondary fermentation in bottle, without any additives with natural sugar only. White flowers, acacia, white peach blossom, pale straw. Medium acidity, medium finish. Slightly metalic.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">♥ Riesling Rosenberg 2021</span>: On red sandstone, the same stone at the door (used to frame the door) of the domaine's tasting room. Smoke, reduction, bacon. Tart citrus, white peach, salty stony minerality. High acidity, long finish on saltiness and tangy zingy acidity.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">♥ Riesling Leimental 2021</span>: On clay soils. Apricot, yellow peach. Meyer lemon, honeyed wet stones especially on the palate. Long finish on apricot juice. Fruit-wrapped high acidity.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Riesling GC Steingrubler 2021</span>: 18 months' long fermentation until all sugar converted to alcohol. Candied lemon, lemon-and-peach-cented minerality, lychee on the palate... Elevated acidity that is tangy and zingy. Medium plus or perhaps long finish.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Pinot Gris Rosenberg 2021</span>: Smoke, reduction, salty salinity. White peach, white apricot, green and slightly yellow millie apple. Dry, medium acidity, medium plus finish on minerality. Ripe orchard fruits. </li>
<li><span style="color:orange">♥ Cuvee 4, 2017</span>: 2017 had seen lots of frosts so cuvee `4` was made to blend 4 grand crus Hengst, Rosenberg, Steingrubler, Pfersigberg.

<h5 style="color:coral">Winzenheim</h5>
<h5 style="color:red" href="">JosMeyer</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Double Guyot, simple Guyot, Poulssard for all varieties.</li>
  <li>Vinification done in very old large oak casks, except very recent experiments of skin contact wine in amphorae.</li>
  <li>Pinot Auxerrois vs Pinot Blanc. Pinot Blanc is more vegetal and has higher acidity.</li>
  <li>Biodynamic since 2002, as tests for solutions to hot summers: sowing cover crops (different growers experiment with different cover crops).</li>
  <li>The family own 94 different plots of 25 hectares. Precision viticulture is used as trellising or pruning methods are chose for each plot.</li>
  <li>2017 was a cold vintage that led to very slow fermentation that caused stress in the cellar fearing stuck fermentation. Non-stable fermentation in oval casks led to 20-30 g/L RS e.g. 20 g/L RS in Brand.</li>
  <li>2015 was a charming hot vintage for Riesling, but maybe too hot for Pinot Gris. They had to pick early to balance the acidity and keep the alcohol low. Pinot Gris Brand 2015 ended up with 14% abv. And during fermentation this Pinot Gris stopped fermentation at 15 g/L RS.</li>
  <li>Brand is a granitic site that calls for more rain. 2km from where JosMeyer is.</li>
  <li>New experiments: three amphoras for Pinot Gris to make dry and precise cuvees as natural wines in 2021 from Pinot Gris. Not using them for Riesling... </li>
  <li>Stopped exporting to US during Trump era dur to tax. So very little exported to US. First export market being Canada esp. Quebec.</li>
  </ul>
<ol>

<li><span style="color:orange">Riesling Hengst 2017</span>: Ripe stone fruits and orchard fruits. Stony minerality. Medium plus acidity. Medium minus finish on acidity and minerality. Bone dry.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Pinot Gris Brand 2015</span>:  Fermented and aged in the same oak cask. Still closed down. Rather muted on the nose: airy chalky minerality. Hot vintage, fruit picked early to retain acidity. 14% abv. Fermentation naturally stopped at 15 g/L RS. Pomaceous fruits - white apple and just ripe apples. Medium plus finish on salty minerality. Medium acidity.</li>

<h5 style="color:coral">Kaysersberg</h5>

<h5 style="color:red" href="">♥ Chambard</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Thanks to Pascaline Lepeltier's recommendation, we wined and dined at Chambard, which was sublime.</li>
  <li>They wine list heavily features tasty Alsace and Jura wines.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:orange">Pinot Noir d'Alsace: Michel - Les Vins Pirouettes2021</span>: Jammy red plum. Slightly overripe raspberry, black plum, blackberry. Pale bright ruby. Barnyard, leather. High acidity, medium minus tannins. Medium plus finish on vanilla cream and yogurt (not from oak).</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Pinot Noir d'Aileus: SCEV Domaine Villet Pinot vin biologique 2020 </span>: Hazy pale ruby.

High tingly acidity. Low tannins. Medium plus finish on tingly acidity and red berries. Medium minus body.</li>
</ol>

<h5 style="color:red" href="">♥ Domaine Weinbach</h5>
<ul>
  <li>We walked all the way from Kaysersberg old town center at the foot of the snow-covered Schlossberg to Domaine Weinbach. The view was the definite highlight of our trip.</li>
  <li>Catherine and Theo (who speaks perfect American English...) graciously received us for tasting in their living room.</li>
  <li>Biodynamic since 1988. Four years of conversion. Pick early for phenolic ripeness.</li>
  <li>New plots obtained since 2019: Pinot Gris and Pinot Blanc parcels in Frustentum and Pinot Noir parcels in Mambourg. Domaine Weinbach is used to mostly sandstone and granite soils and now new plots include more limestone! They have learnt to adapt different cover crops, pruning, canopy, etc. to different soils and vines.</li>
  <li>For instane, granite soils are better clean of cover crops, as they drain off fast. No till needed. On the other hand, limestone soil requires 50% cover crops to bring down vine vigor.</li>
  <li>Snow is even better than rain as it hold water for longer and irrigates slowly. But too much snow could delay pre-pruning (before tha actual pruning in March).</li>
  <li>For instance, granite soils are better for single Guyot, so are younger vines to bring down vigor.</li>
  <li>Oldest vines are 96-year-old Rieslings in Schlossberg Saint-Catherine cuvee. And Gewurztraminer at the bottom of Frustentum and Mambourg.</li>
  <li>Pinot Noir is half whole cluster half destem.</li>
  <li>60% exported, out of which 20% to US.</li>
  <li>Riesling GC Schlossberg SGN used to be vinified in used DRC barrels but over time less used DRC barrels available because of the trend of used barrels, now have to purchase new barrels and break them in. So this wine uses some new oak but less than 20%. Vinification in demi-johns and very small stainless steel tanks less than 400L due to very limited crop. Yearly production of SGN is less than 1%.</li>
  </ul>

<h5 style="color:coral">Staufen</h5>
<h5 style="color:red" href="">Weingut Wasenhaus</h5>
<ul>
<li>Chasselas sourced from Rheinhessen for the first time. Locally called Gutedel. It is very sensitive to everything in the cellar like barrels. 2022 vintage to be bottled in 2023 April. This is the only white wine to be bottled early. 20-25% skin contact. 10-15 days of fermentation. No sulphur.</li>
<li>US importer: vom Boden, desource??? in CA?</li>
<li>All reds use whole cluster, the extent of which depends on clone, whether bunches are compact (more compact more whole cluster), vine age (older more whole cluster), selection massale (more whole cluster), etc.</li>
<li>Vulkan bottling: Pinot Noir fruits that went into Vulkan was mostly on loess soils. Also volcanic. It consists of two plots, one plot was destemmed because of younger vines, on the eastern side of Kaiserstühl. The other plot was whole cluster of the 40-year-old vines on the western part of Kaiserstühl with south-facing slopes.</li>
<li>am kreuz bottling: 40-year-old vines grown on gneiss in Staufen. This wine, interestingly, has a significant amount of Pinot Gris which was co-planted within the vineyard. The wine is 100% whole cluster and fermented with a long carbonic phase; it is finished with a few punch downs. A total fermentation of 20 days and was aged for about 18 months in used barrels. Sadly, Alex told us they lost the vineyard as the owner sold it to someone else without telling them, which was NOT COOL.</li>

<li>2021 was a difficult vintage due to Spring frost and rain. 50% crop loss. So (? logic ?) they made a 100% carbonic macerated Pinot Noir. Grand Ordinaire like 2020 vintage.</li>
<li>The Kanzel bottling: Kanzel is a site high up on the Ehrenstetter Ölberg, above the Möhlin; the soil here is clay and limestone. The Kanzel is a part of the old Ölberg with a slightly more eastern exposition; thus the site is a bit colder and less exposed to the sun and the soils more iron-rich. Half of the vines here are a French selection massale (Bizot clone! from Vosne-Romanee) still young around 10 years old, planted by Dr. Henrik Möbitz with low-vigor rootstocks (the entire parcel Möbitz farmed was sold to Wasenhaus); the other half of the vines are older 40-year-old German clones. The older German clones have more compact bunches whereas the younger French selecrtion massale vines are more variable in bunches, some loose some compact. Alex thinks that in ten years, these vines will be beautiful when more established. Due to the site and clonal differences, the parcels are always vinified separately. Fermented half with whole clusters, with a bit of carbonic fermentation and then transferred to an open-vat for a classic fermentation with minimal punchdowns. The wine was aged in mainly used French oak barrels for about 18 months.</li>
<li>Alex thinks that limestone gives wines chalky fine-grained tannins, whereas volcanic wines are more open than limestone wines at the begining, whereas gneiss gives more fruit. Pinot Noir on limestone always needs more time whereas Pinot Noir on volcanic soils is always open.</li>
<li>They are currently renting this old winery. Wishing for a better winery with for instance better floor better winery space. Would love more volcanic soils!</li>
<li>Alex had been the vineyard manager at de Montille up until 2021. Both Chris and Alex got training in various best-known Burgundy domaines... Alex also mentioned Jura legends when asked about his winemaking inspirations, such as Roulet.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:orange">Chesselas 2021</span>: On loess soils. Refreshingly light at 10% abv. Delicate green apple, lean salinity. Very refreshing. Slightly herbal. A bit of skin contact was used to get some structure. Medium plus acidity, medium plus finish on the lovely texture.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Pinot Blanc 2020</span>: Fermented for one year then aged in barrels for two years. Racked to stainless steel tanks to still age on lees for 1.5 years. Loess soils with some limestone. Lean minerality. High acidity, medium plus acidity on acidity and minerality. Very refreshing. High acidity.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Pinot Noir 2020</span>: Entry level. 20% whole cluster. Pale bright ruby. Medium+ to high acidity that was tangy and tingly. Medium minus finish. Lifted tart cherry, rather floral. No obvious or subtle detectable oak influences.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Falk the winemaker was clearly passionate about what he does, in search of the world's best Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.</li>
  <li>We drove our way from Ribeauville to Weingut Hermann and Wasenhaus in Baden on a clear day after snow. Cruising through the empty river valleys, the snow-covered terraced vines greeted us with breaktaking views. (And of course we were late #facepalm) </li>
  <li>3 hectares of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Sauv Blanc vines. 12-15k bottles per vintage. Two thirds Pinor Noir, one third Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc.</li>
  <li>Loess and volcanic soils with basic pH > 7, similar to soils in Loire...</li>
  <li>Baden is a bit too south/warm for Riesling.</li>
  <li>Inspired by Australian reds, Falk planted some Shiraz vines in 2019. To be blended with Sauv Blanc.</li>
  <li>Chardonnay vines first planted in 2014, after regrafting 50-year-old vines to Chardonnay. Selection massale from a nursery in Alsace (Hebinger in Eguisheim). One year in barrels. Only a little bit of Battonage then stop. Full malo.</li>
  <li>Regenerative viticulture. Organic since 30 years ago. Not certified organic though. No fining.</li>
  <li>Whole bunch press. No deboutage. Long slow pressing, straight to barrels, of which two thirds are new Burgundy.</li>
  <li>When asked which cooperage. Falk shared a fun story: his friend who loves fishing used to work in a famous domaine in Vosne-Romanee. One day his car gave up on his way to a fishing trip, he randomly walked into a cooper (that's not Francois Freres...), used by Meo-Camuzet (though I thought Meo-camuzet mostly uses Francois Freres?!). That's how he got to find his barrels.</li>
  <li>Pinot Noir: No whole bunch. 100% destem, with 10% stem inclusion (added back in after destemming). Crushed berries. Fermented in open-top wooden casks. Five days of cold maceration then natural fermentation. Remontage twice per day. Pigeage only at the end of fermentation if temperature exceeded 30 Celsius degrees. Then press and transfer into first, second, and third filled used barriques. 16-24 months aging in barriques. Then filter with cloth sheets only once before bottling. Clones: 40% 333 clone, 60% German local clones. The newer German clones have smaller berries (tighter shoulder?) whereas the older clones were selected in vineyard in 1960s-1970s. And Faively clone used in Alsace. Burgundy clones 150 ad 103.</li>
  <li>2019 was a difficult year. Late frosts caused up to 50% crop loss in some vineyards, losing two thirds of the Burgundy clones. So only one bottling, when in good years, usually 3-4 Pinot Noir bottlings.</li>
  <li>Cantus Avis: ``bird song`` the bird's slope we drove through the snow-covered valley. Vines planted since 1999. Cantus Avis includes three vineyards. Since 2017, the best plot within goes into the `reserve` bottling, which is not made every vintage. Reserve bottlings were made in 2010 (first vintage), 2011, 2017, 2018, 2020. Reserve and non-reserve bottlings were vinified the same way. Yields at 3 tons per hectare. 2000L per hectare. 10% new barrels for both bottling and 25% stem inclusion for 2017 vintage. </li>
  <li>Thoughts on climate change: leaf plugging. Different ways of planting like closer to ground... High canopy means greater need for water intake, which would be more difficult in the future. Especially difficult for Pinot Gris because early ripening with thin skin thus more careful about sugar upshoot velocity. For Pinot Noir the strategies perhaps lie more in vineyard techniques. With climate change, the picking window shrinks and everything has to be picked in a short period of time, which could cause logistical challenges (this was more mentioned in when we were visiting Turley in Paso Robles two weeks before). At weingut Hermann, the 2022 harvest started Sep 11 and done in five days, in the sequence of Sauv Blanc, Pinot Noir, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay. Mostly at 93-96 Oechsles.</li>
  <li>Thoughts on Baden: all together 400 hectares, many by coops where grapes were paid by sugar content.</li>
  <li>Picking/harveting based on tasting the grapes and seeds and pips, besides the lab analysis.</li>
  <li>2018 vintage resulted in more hedonistic Pinot Noir wines than 2017. Grapes picked at identical sugar levels as those in 2017, with a bit more acidity than 2017. 2022 vintage will be similar to 2018.</li>
  <li>No US importer. Only exported to Belgium and Netherlands.</li>
  <li>German wine labeling regulation: if a wine is 12.8% abv, it can be labeled as 13%. But if a wine is 12.7%, it can be labeled as 13% or 12.5%.</li>
  <li>Also notes from non-stop geeking out with Falk about best Pinot Noir producers around the world: Ganevat (just sold to Russian investor), Bass Philip in Gipsland, Delamare in Tasmania. Read Phil Laing's book Tasmanian Wines. Stephano Lubiano. Talbot? Domaine Pipiere, George Noallet. Rolet.</li>
  <li>The annual organic biodynamic wine festival in March in Gevingey. 15 min to Ganevat.</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:orange">Sauv Blanc 2021</span>: All stainless steel. Early picking during the first week of September. But suffered from winter frost last year. In very warm years like 2022, used neutral oak was used for Sauv Blanc. Falk looks up to Didier Deagueneau for oak aging Sauvignon Blanc. This is clearly a very high quality Sauvignon Blanc. Gold color. Medium plus acidity, medium plus finish. Grass, ripe citrus, Meyer lemon, white apricot. Textural breath on the palate.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Chardonnay 2020</span>: Reduction. Oyster shell saltiness. Just ripe yellow delicious apples. Yellow peach, Brioche, baking spices. Bone dry on palate. Medium acidity. 7 g/L acidity. Full malo. Long finish.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Pinor Noir 2019</span>: 13% abv. Crunchy red cherry. Pale ruby. Lifted red cherry blossom, tomato flowers. Some earth too. Medium plus acidity, medium plus finish on red fruits. Low tannins.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Pinot Noir 2019 ***</span>: 13.5% abv. Pale ruby. Lifted aromatics. Tart red cherry. Subtle oak. Medium slightly tangy acidity. Medium tannins. Black tea leaves, some earthy notes like mushroom. Lovely texture on the palate.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Pinot Noir Cantus Avis 2017</span>: Medium plus acidity, medium tannins, long finish. Oak spices, tart red cherry, black tea, cola. Pale ruby.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Pinot Noir Cantus Avis Reserve 2017</span>: Dried tea leaves, some green roasted leaves. Cola nuts. Muted red cherry, tart crunchy red cherry. Pale ruby. High acidity, long finish, medium tannins. Finishes on sweet baking spices from oak.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange">Pinot Noir Cantus Avis 2018</span>: Pale ruby. Oak spices. Red and dark cherry. More rose petal. More pink colored (in terms of fruit profile) than 2017. Allspice. Blackberry. Red licorice. Medium acidity, medium plus tannins, long finish.</li>

<li><span style="color:orange">Pinot Noir Cantus Avis Reserve 2018</span>: 13% abv. Dried rose petal. Medium plus acidity. Medium concentration of ruby color. Vanilla toast. Clove. Very supple tannins. High/medium+ acidity. Medium plus tannins.</li>
