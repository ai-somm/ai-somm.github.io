<h3 style="color:fuchsia;" name="winetalk">Trip Report</h4>
<h4 style="color:orange"><a href="#alsace">Alsace</a> | <a href="#baden">Baden</a> | <a href="#pfalz">Pfalz</a></h4> 

<p>We made our cross-Atlantic trip to Alsace in December 2022, with clear intentions of visiting as many domaines in Alsace as we could, wandering around some Christmas markets, and perhaps hitting some weinguts in Baden and Pfalz in passing.</p>

<p>We flew Lufthansa from SFO to FRA and took the Lufthansa express bus down to Strasbourg. The next morning we rented a car and started driving south and visiting domaines along the way. We stayed in Ribeauville for six nights as our base for winery visits in Alsace and Baden. We then drove up to Deidesheim as our base for winery visits in Pfalz.</p>

<h5 style="color:pink">Lessons Learnt - Trip Logistics</h5>

  <p>Almost all Alsacien wineries require reservations in advance. How far in advance depends on its popularity. For example, Zind-Humbrecht requires 6-8 weeks in advance, and as does Domaine Weinbach. But most other wineries can be scheduled with a few days' or just one day's notice.</p>
  <p>Many Pfalz wineries with tasting rooms welcome walk-ins and do not take reservations. Smaller wineries do require reservations like Alsacien wineries, but most can be scheduled promptly.</p>
  <p>Wine suitcase (mine is VinGardeValise bought at $369) is probably the best solution so far for taking a case or two back home (to US) with us. Haus Packs (inflatable air columns as cushioning) with air pumps are the best wine sleeves for wrapping small numbers of bottles.</p>
  <p>Direct shipping with Cote d'Or Imports (with which Marcel Deiss works) or MBE (with which Marc Tempe works) turns out to be our choice for shipping cases of wines back home. A case runs about $190 but you don't have to pay taxes (which you would pay if you were to go with wine suitcases as checked luggage.).</p>
  <p>Tasting at five domaines per day sounds ambitious but is totally feasible if planned meticulously :)</p>
  <p>DO make dinner reservations for restaurants! Restaurants open at very restricted hours and are always fully booked. We learnt it the hard way.</p>

<h5 style="color:pink">Lessons Learnt - Wine Study</h5>


   <p>Many Alsacien producers have been experimenting Syrah or Shiraz in light of global warming with encouraging results. None released yet, but may well be in a few years.</p>
   <p>Almost every Alsacien producer makes skin contact (orange) wines off Pinot Gris or Gewurtztraminer.</p>
   <p>Alsace, Pfalz, and Baden have been the overlooked, underrated, and best value premier Pinor Noir producing regions for quite a while now.</p>
   <p>Klevener de Heiligenstein: pink-skinned Savagnin Rose variety that's been planted and vinified by very few domaines left. Usually with some skin-contact or in an oxidative style.</p>
   <p>Pinot Blanc and Auxerrois: as is well known these two are usually blended. One could make a 100% Auxerrois cuvee and label it as Pinot Blanc, but not the other way around (though nor would anyone do such thing...).</p>
   <p>After this trip of 28 wineries (domaines, weinguts) tasting through a few hundreds of wines including various expressions of the same grand cru sites, I finally got a hang of how to taste soil types or lieux-dix in wines... the crushed wet stone kinda minerality in Rangen, the salty minerality in Schlossberg, and the tension and smoke in Kastelberg...</p>
   <p>All the Alsacien producers we tasted at swear by selection massal off Burgundy scions offered by local nurseries, and are under constant stress of mildews, frosts, and esca pressures with nepoviruses also an issue in Pfalz, whereas Pfalz and Baden producers we tasted at use a mix of German clones and Burgundy clones like Dijon for Pinot Noir.</p>
   <p>Being the mosaic landscape of soil compositions in Alsace, every grand cru (now 51, soon to be 53) is unique in its own way. However, sandstone appears to be everywhere, volcanic soils appears to be the most characterful and distinctive in terms of manifestation in wines, such as Rangen (volcanic) and Kastelberg (slate). And the same, I'd argue, goes with Forst (volcanic) in Pfalz.</p>
  <p>Two new grand cru sites just got approved on May 13, 2022 for Pinot Noir: Kirchsberg de Barr (limestone), Hengst (limestone-marl). They will go into effect in 2023.</p>
  <p>We learnt about various changes happeninng at different domaines to hedge against global warming: from starting to blend warmer sites with cooler sites (Bechtold) to experimenting with alternative grape varieties such as Syrah and Shiraz (JosMeyer, Bott-Geyl, Meyer Fonne, etc.), from using coal as compost material to increase soil water holding capacity (Koehler-Ruprecht) to pushing for biodynamic and/or regenerative viticulture to improve the resilience of vines (Lissner, Bechtold, Zind-Humbrecht, Schoffit, etc. too many.), from experimenting with echalas for vine training (Marc Kreydenweiss) to tailoring Poulssard, simple or double Guyot for each vine (JosMeyer, Weinbach, etc.). Global warming is clearly on every grower's mind and everyone is actively seeking solutions.</p>


<h4 style="color:orange" name="alsace">Alsace</h4>

<h5 style="color:coral">Marlenheim</h5>

<h5 style="color:red" href="http://bechtold.alsace/">Domaine Bechtold</h5>
<p>Organic and biodynamic since QQQ. The Bechtold family in the neat little town of Marleheim 20 minutes west of Strasbourg, vinifies Riesling, Muscat, Gewurtztraminer, and Cremant in stainless steel tanks and Pinor Noir, Pinot Meunier in 4th fill pieces from Burgundy. As part of Neal Rosenthal's portfolio, they are visited by Neal every January, when Neal tastes all the current releases and decides on which ones and how many to import. So far, Neal has only been taking dry wines from them. One interesting bit about how Neal took skin-contact Gewurtztraminer: when he tasted it, he was really impressed but had to seek confirmation so he called Jeremy immediately and got off the phone with a 900-bottle deal.</p>
<p>The tasting room is clearly just a room in their family home retrofitted to include a tasting counter. The house cat -- a tripod orange tabby GIRL with only one paw happily roamed around and greeted us. Marie QQQ warmly received us and she told us that her son QQQ has taken over the winemaking and is vacationing to return around Xmas. Interestingly at our tasting at Marc Kreydenweiss that followed immediately after, we learnt that QQQ interned with Marc Kreydenweiss and the two domaines have been very close with one another.</p>
<p>Vintage 2018 was a great year with a dry spring, and really nice weathers during summer -- dry, and not too hot.</p>
<p>Vintage 2020 was a hot year, leading to aromatic whites at the domaine.</p>
<p>Vintage 2021 was a rather difficult vintage. It was raining all summer, which led to lots of mildews. The family tried their best to keep mildrews under control but still lost 40% yield, which has never happened in the past 40 years. To combat mildews, they resorted to the biodynamic measures: using sting nettles, prele??, picking when the sap flow is at the lowest, spraying tea essence, and the cream of grass and tea, etc.-=f</p>

<h5 style="color:yellow">♥ Riesling Sussenberg 2018</h5><p>Petrol, chalky minerality, apricot, Meyer lemon. Fruit-wrapped high acidity. Long creamy finish. 32-year-old vines on limestone just under GC Engelberg. 2018 will be the last vintage of this wine as the site is getting warmer with climate change. Therefore starting 2020, this lieu-dit will be blended with another cooler lieu-dit Silbersberg.</p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">Riesling Le Nef 2020:</h5><p>Lemon oil, Meyer lemon, peach blossom, chalky minerality. High acidity and elevated finish. The parcel dates back from 1405 and the label is inspired from the Noah's Ark. </p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">Riesling GC 2020 Engelberg</h5><p>Hefty aromatics of white flowers, citrus zest, lemon blossom, minerality. High acidity and long finish on minerality.</p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">Pinot Gris Silberberg 2018</h5><p>Reductive and leesy. Strong minerality with some smoke, stone frruited -- just ripe yellow peach, apple, and apricot. Long finish with a touch of phenolic bitterness. Aged in QQQ.</p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">♥ Pinot Gris comme un Rouge 2018</h5><p>Maceration on skin for one week. Pigeage every day. Pale salmon in color. Slightly oxidative on the nose: walnut and pine. Honey, peach, minearlity. Very dry. Almost phenolic. Elevated finish on creamy minerality.</p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">♥ Gewurtztraminer sec comme un Rouge 2019.</h5><p>Pale salmon in color. Lychee, honeysuckle, orange & orange peel, tomato, minerality, musk, and allspices. Medium acidity, elevated finish. ~14% abv.</p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">Lotus 2020</h5><p>The newest cuvee that hasn't been tasted by Neal yet. Skin contact of half Muscat and half Gewurtztraminer. Vinified separately because different harvest times and different volumes. One week maceration for each variety. Pale salmon in color. Aromatics of lychee blossom, marigold flowers. When we asked why the name Lotus, Marie burst into laughter QQQ</p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">Brut Nature</h5><p>Chardonnay and Auxerrois, sometimes with Pinot Noir. Non-dosage. All stainless steel alcoholic fermentation. White flowers (acacia), fresh citrus, and minerality. Bone dry.</p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">♥ Pinot Noir Argentoratum (written on the label shaped like a castle, the Roman word of Alsace)</h5><p>Purity of fruit. Crushed straberry, fresh raspberry. Elevated acidity and finish. Half destemmed and half whole cluster. Pigeage for 2-3 days, remontage every day for two weeks, then slow and long press with pneumatic press to avoid astringency from stems. Then put into 4th-fill barriques.</p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">Gewurtztraminer 2018 (VT)</h5><p>Not made every year. Usually harvested at the end of October, more than one month earlier than the normal 50 years ago, when harvested usually started in December. Mineral water, musk, allspices, orange juice. Elevated acidity, medium finish.</p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">Gewurtztraminer GC Engelberg 2018</h5><p>Smoke! Allspices! Curry spices, lychee & lychee leaf, minerality. Sweet. Medium acidity, and elevated satisfying finish. 17% abv. 2018 was the last vintage so far. 200 cases produced. It's getting harder to produce this bottling with climate change.</p>


<h5 style="color:coral">Andlau</h5>
<h5 style="color:red" href="http://www.kreydenweiss.com/alsace/10/18/the-winery/">Marc Kreydenweiss</h5>
<p>Perhaps best known for their GC Kastelberg bottling on the powerful black schist soils. Marc Kreydenweiss was helmed by the Marc family since 1984. Low yielding, low intervention in celler, and focused on terrior expressions, 1985 marked the full conversion to biodynamic viticulture. In 1990, the family purchased the Wuhenry QQQ in Languedoc, which is now managed by Jean. In 2007, Antoine took over winemaking in the Alsace/Andlau domaine. All wines in Alsace are vinified in the traditional foudres, and all wines in Languedoc are vinified in stainless steel and concrete tanks.</p>
<p>A small experimental plot of vines are trained high on single stalk (echalas), like those commonly seen in northern Rhone.</p>
<p>Vintage 2020 was warm and dry with healthy fruit thus easy harvest. Wines have the profile of cooler vintages such as 2019 but with even better freshness.</p>
<p>Two US importers: AP Imports and Williams Connor Wine.</p>

<h5 style="color:yellow">Brut Nature. Lune a Boire (moon to drink). NV</h5><p>Two years aging on lees. Minerality, toast, creme fraiche, salinity. Creamy and salty. Elevated acidity and finish.</p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">Kritt 2020 (50% Pinot Blanc, 50% Auxerrois) </h5><p>Clay soil with quartz stones which impart freshness to wine. 15 months in foudres. Pale straw, honey, apricot, honeysuckle. Smells very sweet on the nose (slightly petrol?) Zingy high acidity, elevated finishes on tartness.</p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">Au Dessus de la Loi</h5><p>On pink sandstone typical of northern Alsace, which makes a wine floral. Petrol, ripe citrus - Meyer lemon oil, lemon blossom, minerality. High acidity, elevated/long finish on citrus and minerality.</p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">La Fontaine. 2017</h5><p>North-facing late-ripening Riesling vines planted at high altitute in a cool microclimate, on granite soils that give wines an airy texture. Fresh lemon oil and lemon blossom, herbal jasmine tea. Medium acidity, elevated finish with more fruit presence and less tart.</p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">Clos du Val d'Eleon. 2018</h5><p>Cool site in a warmer vintage on blue schist (slate as in Mosel, which is rare in Alsace). Slaty minerality, precision, high acidity, elevated finish, 13% abv. Riesling and Pinot Gris coplanted and cofermented.</p>
<h5 style="color:yellow">♥ Riesling GC Wiebelsberg. 2017</h5><p>Steep and sunny slopes of Wiebelsberg on pink sandstone. Salty salinity and smoky minerality. Tart citrus, white peach. Elevated acidity, long creamy finish.</p>

<h5 style="color:yellow">♥ Riesling GC Kastelberg. 2020</h5><p>Just bottled, after over two years aging on lees. Such a baby. Quite closed. Salty minerality. Green apple, Asian pear, oyster shell, fresh herbs, white peach. High acidity. Long finish on citrus and salinity.</p>
