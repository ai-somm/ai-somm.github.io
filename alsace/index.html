<h3 style="color:fuchsia;" name="winetalk">Trip Report</h4>
<h4 style="color:orange"><a href="#alsace">Alsace</a> | <a href="#baden">Baden</a> | <a href="#pfalz">Pfalz</a></h4> 

<p>We made our cross-Atlantic trip to Alsace in December 2022, with clear intentions of visiting as many domaines in Alsace as we could, wandering around some Christmas markets, and perhaps hitting some weinguts in Baden and Pfalz in passing.</p>

<p>We flew Lufthansa from SFO to FRA and took the Lufthansa express bus down to Strasbourg. The next morning we rented a car and started driving south and visiting domaines along the way. We stayed in Ribeauville for six nights as our base for winery visits in Alsace and Baden. We then drove up to Deidesheim as our base for winery visits in Pfalz.</p>

<h5 style="color:pink">Lessons Learnt - Trip Logistics</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Almost all Alsacien wineries require reservations in advance. How far in advance depends on its popularity. For example, Zind-Humbrecht requires 6-8 weeks in advance, and as does Domaine Weinbach. But most other wineries can be scheduled with a few days' or just one day's notice.</li>
  <li>Many Pfalz wineries with tasting rooms welcome walk-ins and do not take reservations. Smaller wineries do require reservations like Alsacien wineries, but most can be scheduled promptly.</li>
  <li>Wine suitcase (mine is VinGardeValise bought at $369) is probably the best solution so far for taking a case or two back home (to US) with us. Haus Packs (inflatable air columns as cushioning) with air pumps are the best wine sleeves for wrapping small numbers of bottles.</li>
  <li>Direct shipping with Cote d'Or Imports (with which Marcel Deiss works) or MBE (with which Marc Tempe works) turns out to be our choice for shipping cases of wines back home. A case runs about $190 but you don't have to pay taxes (which you would pay if you were to go with wine suitcases as checked luggage.).</li>
  <li>Tasting at five domaines per day sounds ambitious but is totally feasible if planned meticulously :)</li>
  <li>DO make dinner reservations for restaurants! Restaurants open at very restricted hours and are always fully booked. We learnt it the hard way.</li>
</ul>
<h5 style="color:pink">Lessons Learnt - Wine Study</h5>

<ul>
   <li> Many Alsacien producers have been experimenting Syrah or Shiraz in light of global warming with encouraging results. None released yet, but may well be in a few years.</li>
   <li> Almost every Alsacien producer makes skin contact (orange) wines off Pinot Gris or Gewurtztraminer.</li>
   <li> Alsace, Pfalz, and Baden have been the overlooked, underrated, and best value premier Pinor Noir producing regions for quite a while now.</li>
   <li> Klevener de Heiligenstein: pink-skinned Savagnin Rose variety that's been planted and vinified by very few domaines left. Usually with some skin-contact or in an oxidative style.</li>
   <li> Pinot Blanc and Auxerrois: as is well known these two are usually blended. One could make a 100% Auxerrois cuvee and label it as Pinot Blanc, but not the other way around (though nor would anyone do such thing...).</li>
   <li> After this trip of 28 wineries (domaines, weinguts) tasting through a few hundreds of wines including various expressions of the same grand cru sites, I finally got a hang of how to taste soil types or lieux-dix in wines... the crushed wet stone kinda minerality in Rangen, the salty minerality in Schlossberg, and the tension and smoke in Kastelberg...</li>
   <li> All the Alsacien producers we tasted at swear by selection massal off Burgundy scions offered by local nurseries, and are under constant stress of mildews, frosts, and esca pressures with nepoviruses also an issue in Pfalz, whereas Pfalz and Baden producers we tasted at use a mix of German clones and Burgundy clones like Dijon for Pinot Noir.</li>
   <li> Being the mosaic landscape of soil compositions in Alsace, every grand cru (now 51, soon to be 53) is unique in its own way. However, sandstone appears to be everywhere, volcanic soils appears to be the most characterful and distinctive in terms of manifestation in wines, such as Rangen (volcanic) and Kastelberg (slate). And the same, I'd argue, goes with Forst (volcanic) in Pfalz.</li>
  <li> Two new grand cru sites just got approved on May 13, 2022 for Pinot Noir: Kirchsberg de Barr (limestone), Hengst (limestone-marl). They will go into effect in 2023.</li>
  <li> We learnt about various changes happeninng at different domaines to hedge against global warming: from starting to blend warmer sites with cooler sites (Bechtold) to experimenting with alternative grape varieties such as Syrah and Shiraz (JosMeyer, Bott-Geyl, Meyer Fonne, etc.), from using coal as compost material to increase soil water holding capacity (Koehler-Ruprecht) to pushing for biodynamic and/or regenerative viticulture to improve the resilience of vines (Lissner, Bechtold, Zind-Humbrecht, Schoffit, etc. too many.), from experimenting with echalas for vine training (Marc Kreydenweiss) to tailoring Poulssard, simple or double Guyot for each vine (JosMeyer, Weinbach, etc.). Global warming is clearly on every grower's mind and everyone is actively seeking solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h5 style="color:pink">Domaines we missed and would definitely like to visit next time around:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Leon Beyer</li>
<li>Domaine Mure</li>
<li>Three Manns: Albert Mann, Jean-Louis Mann, ???</li>
<li>Albert Boxler, Justin Boxler</li>

<h4 style="color:orange" name="alsace">Alsace</h4>

<h5 style="color:coral">Marlenheim</h5>

<h5 style="color:red" href="http://bechtold.alsace/">Domaine Bechtold</h5>
<ul>
<li>Organic and biodynamic since QQQ. The Bechtold family in the neat little town of Marleheim 20 minutes west of Strasbourg, vinifies Riesling, Muscat, Gewurtztraminer, and Cremant in stainless steel tanks and Pinor Noir, Pinot Meunier in 4th fill pieces from Burgundy. As part of Neal Rosenthal's portfolio, they are visited by Neal every January, when Neal tastes all the current releases and decides on which ones and how many to import. So far, Neal has only been taking dry wines from them. One interesting bit about how Neal took skin-contact Gewurtztraminer: when he tasted it, he was really impressed but had to seek confirmation so he called Jeremy immediately and got off the phone with a 900-bottle deal.</li>
<li>The tasting room is clearly just a room in their family home retrofitted to include a tasting counter. The house cat -- a tripod orange tabby GIRL with only one paw happily roamed around and greeted us. Marie QQQ warmly received us and she told us that her son QQQ has taken over the winemaking and is vacationing to return around Xmas. Interestingly at our tasting at Marc Kreydenweiss that followed immediately after, we learnt that QQQ interned with Marc Kreydenweiss and the two domaines have been very close with one another.</li>
<li>Vintage 2018 was a great year with a dry spring, and really nice weathers during summer -- dry, and not too hot.</li>
<li>Vintage 2020 was a hot year, leading to aromatic whites at the domaine.</li>
<li>Vintage 2021 was a rather difficult vintage. It was raining all summer, which led to lots of mildews. The family tried their best to keep mildrews under control but still lost 40% yield, which has never happened in the past 40 years. To combat mildews, they resorted to the biodynamic measures: using sting nettles, prele??, picking when the sap flow is at the lowest, spraying tea essence, and the cream of grass and tea, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:yellow">♥ Riesling Sussenberg 2018</span>: Petrol, chalky minerality, apricot, Meyer lemon. Fruit-wrapped high acidity. Long creamy finish. 32-year-old vines on limestone just under GC Engelberg. 2018 will be the last vintage of this wine as the site is getting warmer with climate change. Therefore starting 2020, this lieu-dit will be blended with another cooler lieu-dit Silbersberg.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Riesling Le Nef 2020</span>: Lemon oil, Meyer lemon, peach blossom, chalky minerality. High acidity and elevated finish. The parcel dates back from 1405 and the label is inspired from the Noah's Ark. </li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Riesling GC Engelberg 2020</span>: Hefty aromatics of white flowers, citrus zest, lemon blossom, minerality. High acidity and long finish on minerality.</li>

Vinified separately because different harvest times and different volumes. One week maceration for each variety. Pale salmon in color. Aromatics of lychee blossom, marigold flowers. When we asked why the name Lotus, Marie burst into laughter QQQ</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Brut Nature</span>: Chardonnay and Auxerrois, sometimes with Pinot Noir. Non-dosage. All stainless steel alcoholic fermentation. White flowers (acacia), fresh citrus, and minerality. Bone dry.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">♥ Pinot Noir Argentoratum (written on the label shaped like a castle, the Roman word of Alsace)</span>: Purity of fruit. Crushed straberry, fresh raspberry. Elevated acidity and finish. Half destemmed and half whole cluster. Pigeage for 2-3 days, remontage every day for two weeks, then slow and long press with pneumatic press to avoid astringency from stems. Then put into 4th-fill barriques.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Gewurtztraminer 2018 (VT)</span>: Not made every year. Usually harvested at the end of October, more than one month earlier than the normal 50 years ago, when harvested usually started in December. Mineral water, musk, allspices, orange juice. Elevated acidity, medium finish.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Gewurtztraminer GC Engelberg 2018</span>: Smoke! Allspices! Curry spices, lychee & lychee leaf, minerality. Sweet. Medium acidity, and elevated satisfying finish. 17% abv. 2018 was the last vintage so far. 200 cases produced. It's getting harder to produce this bottling with climate change.</li>
</ol>

<h5 style="color:coral">Andlau</h5>
<h5 style="color:red" href="http://www.kreydenweiss.com/alsace/10/18/the-winery/">Marc Kreydenweiss</h5>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps best known for their GC Kastelberg bottling on the powerful black schist soils. Marc Kreydenweiss was helmed by the Marc family since 1984. Low yielding, low intervention in celler, and focused on terrior expressions, 1985 marked the full conversion to biodynamic viticulture. In 1990, the family purchased the Wuhenry QQQ in Languedoc, which is now managed by Jean. In 2007, Antoine took over winemaking in the Alsace/Andlau domaine. All wines in Alsace are vinified in the traditional foudres, and all wines in Languedoc are vinified in stainless steel and concrete tanks.</li>
<li>A small experimental plot of vines are trained high on single stalk (echalas), like those commonly seen in northern Rhone.</li>
<li>Their Pinot Noir is made with short maceration, no new oak, no cold soak, 100% whole cluster, with destemming only used in difficult vintages.</li>
<li>Vintage 2020 was warm and dry with healthy fruit thus easy harvest. Wines have the profile of cooler vintages such as 2019 but with even better freshness. Harvest usually starts early mid September, and lasts until early to mid October.</li>
<li>Each year an artist is commissioned to create label arts.</li>
<li>Two US importers: AP Imports and Williams Connor Wine in Virginia.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Brut Nature - Lune a Boire (moon to drink) NV</span>: Two years aging on lees. Minerality, toast, creme fraiche, salinity. Creamy and salty. Elevated acidity and finish.</li>

Pale straw, honey, apricot, honeysuckle. Smells very sweet on the nose (slightly petrol?) Zingy high acidity, elevated finishes on tartness.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Au Dessus de la Loi</span>: On pink sandstone typical of northern Alsace, which makes a wine floral. Petrol, ripe citrus - Meyer lemon oil, lemon blossom, minerality. High acidity, elevated/long finish on citrus and minerality.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">La Fontaine 2017</span>: North-facing late-ripening Riesling vines planted at high altitute in a cool microclimate, on granite soils that give wines an airy texture. Fresh lemon oil and lemon blossom, herbal jasmine tea. Medium acidity, elevated finish with more fruit presence and less tart.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Clos du Val d'Eleon 2018</span>: Cool site in a warmer vintage on blue schist (slate as in Mosel, which is rare in Alsace). Slaty minerality, precision, high acidity, elevated finish, 13% abv. Riesling and Pinot Gris coplanted and cofermented.</li>

</ol>
<h5 style="color:coral">Ribeauville</h5>
This is the base we picked for our stay. Next to Maison Trimbach, surrounded by GCs Osterberg and Geisberg, the blend of which goes into Trimbach Cuvee Frederic Emile.

<h5 style="color:red" href="">Kientzler</h5>
<ul>
<li>Kientzler makes such beautifully terrior-focused wines. On their labels, only grand cru terriors are featured whereas grape varieties fade into the background as a tiny letter print. For instance, an R enclosed by a minimalist square represents Riesling, as does G Gewurtztraminer, or M Muscat, etc. All stainless steel vinification to let the terrior shine. All wines are bottled the year after, and released after years aged in bottle. This is one of the domaines that showcases soils and terriors the most crystal clear. Their Riesling GC Kirchberg smells and tastes much more similar to their Muscat or Pinot Gris GC Kirchberg than their Riesling GC Geisberg or lieu-dit Muhlfost. </li>
<li>Vintage 2019 resulted in more concentrated wines at low yield at 40 hl/ha.</li>
<li>Geisberg is a very challenging terrior featuring very steep slopes on limestone and sandstone. Odium, esca, and mildews are common threats, and trunks are renewed (recépage) to combat these fungal disease.  Kientzler produces 3000-6000 bottles every vintage. Compared to Muscat (messier cluster than Riesling), Riesling clusters are tighter.</li>
<li>50% exported. 30 hectares that come out between 50k and 70k bottles per vintage. US importer: AP Imports.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Muscat GC Kirchberg 2017</span>: Cool climate, 200 meters left of the tasting room (the house). Southwest facing, 65-66 years old vines on marl sandstone. Kirchberg means mountain of church. Stainless steel vinification. Bone dry with 1g/L RS. This does not smell like your typical terpene-driven highly aromatically floral Muscat at all. Precisely steely minerality. Hints of fruits. Chalky texture. Muscat-sque fruit on the finish. Medium acidity and medium finish.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Riesling lieu-dit Muhlfost 2019</span>: South-facing gentle slopes of marl soils at lower elevation than Kirchberg with a warmer microclimate. Ripe citrus, pepper, minerality of white chalks, white flowers. High acidity, bone dry at 2g/L RS, elevated finish on chalky minerality. 13.5%.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Geisberg Riesling 2018</span>: Steep slopes on limestone and sandstone. Candied lemon and lime, white flowers. Airy chalky and stony minerality. High acidity, elevated finish on searing acidity.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Pinot Gris Kirchberg 2019</span>: Very similar to Muscat GC Kirchberg on the nose. More steely/metaly minerality. Lean salinity. Tart peach, sour lemon, tart pomaceous fruits. Medium acidity, elevated finish on tartness and steely minerality.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Pinot Gris Reserve Particuliere 2018</span>: Riper fruit harvested from hillside. Green apple, white almond, ripe pomaceous fruits, chalky minerality. Off-dry with phenolic bitterness. 15g/L RS.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Gewurtztraminer GC Osterberg 2018</span>: Fainted lychee on the nose. Sour lemon. Steely mineral water. Fresh mango. Sweet - 50g/L RS. Elevated acidity and finish on lychee and minerality.</li>
</ol>
<h5 style="color:red" href="">Maison Trimbach</h5>
<ul>
<li>Vintage 17 - hot vintage (? I don't think so...) that resulted in ripe and healthy grapes.</li>
<li>Vintage 19 - cooler vintage.</li>
<li>Never produced any Riesling VT or SGN since 2001 because of global warming that resulted in vintages too hot and dry for Botrytis formation on Riesling. Vintage 2022 was very hot which resulted in ripe and healthy grapes but no Botrytis either.</li>
<li>2006 was a rainy and cool vintage.</li>
<li>2015 was sunny warm vintage in Alsace too.</li>
<li>In Alsace, Riesling makes up 20% of white wine production. At Trimbach, Riesling makes up 75% white wine production.</li>
<li>All vines are on double Guyot except Pinot Noir cuvee 7 which is on single Guyot to allow for more concentration, as Pinot Noir reserve vines are also on double Guyot.
<li>Harvest usually starts a minimum of two weeks after legal harvest date. 2022 vintage started early September, whereas the previous three years the harvest started early October. Less and less of this cuvee is getting produced, with AOC rules getting stricter. 90% wine production at Trimbach is dry.</li>
<li>92% exported, out of which 50% to US, more to HK, less to mainland China due to Covid restrictinos.</li>
</ul>

<ol>

Oldest vintage dates from 1717. 90% stainless steel and 10% old wooden vats for vinification. 2 g/L RS. 8 g/L acidity. Still quite closed in 2022. Faint white flowers, sweet chalky stone. Cuvee Frederic Emile was first produced in 1960s. Barack Obama drank this when he received the Nobel prize in peace in 2009. King of Sweden toasted birthdays with it too. 20k-30k bottles produced per vintage.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">♥ Clos St Hune 2015</span>: Gold in color. Petrol. Apricot, yellow peach, and tropical fruits such as mango. Chalky minerality. Very ripe fruit profile. Sweet at 24 g/L RS. Elevated / medium+ acidity at 6 g/L acidity. Very Baroque on the palate.</li>

<h5 style="color:red" href="">Hugel</h5>

<h5 style="color:coral">Zellenberg</h5>
<h5 style="color:red" href="">♥ Marc Tempe ♥</h5>
<ul>
<li>This is one of the tastings we will not forget. Marc Tempé is both a former lab technician and vineyard expert for the INAO. He helped select lieux-dits for possible inclusion in the AOC system. In 1993, Marc and his wife Anne-Marie took over his family’s domaine, re-establishing it as their own; they also inherited additional vineyard plots from both of their families. They completed conversion to full biodynamic farming in 1995. Upon entering, we were greeted by We were invited into a tasting room that is apparently the living room of the family house. Anne-Marie guided us through the tasting, with their dog biting her braided hair throughout :)
</li>
<li>Anne-Marie told us that their daughter owns the wine store La Sommeliere in Colmar, where we later went and met Mac, and where we obtained their wines and got them shipped back to the States.</li>
<li>2022 vintage was a very hot vintage, thus difficult as there was too much sunlight.</li>
<li>2019 was a warm and dry year, with no Botrytis.</li>
<li>In 2018, there was some Botrytis and fermentation stopped earlier even though weather was similar to 2019.</li>
<li>2021 vintage was opposite to 2022 with no sunshine, lots of rain that raised a lot of mildew pressure.</li>
<li>Most exported to Japan, and very little to US through distributor Vintage 59.</li>
<li>Before we left, Anne-Marie asked which domaines are we heading to next. We said it was gonna be Marcel Deiss. She immediately told us she thinks Marcel Deiss is one of the best domaines in Alsace and we would have a really nice tasting there.</li>
</ul>

</ol>

<h5 style="color:coral">Bergheim</h5>
<h5 style="color:red" href="">♥ Domaine Marcel Deiss ♥</h5>
<ul>
<li>Marcel Deiss needs no introduction. Best known for their coplanted ancient vines that go into co-fermented cuvees that put emphases on terrior expressions rather varietal characters. Vines ages range between 80-85 years old. Coplanted vines are all harvested at the same time. Massale selection in practice.</li>
<li>For instance, in Marcel Deiss's GC Altenberg plot, there are over 85 different varieties (of any color), at least 3-5 massale selected Riesling varieties. And their oldest vines are in GC Schoenenberg.</li> 
<li>Not all its neighbors buy such a philosophy. For instance, when we were visiting Domaine Weinbach the next day tasting their newest cuvee that is a blend of Pinot Gris and Gewurtztraminer of their newly acquired parcels. Theo Faller specifically told us that they don't think the coplantation works well as different varieties ripen at different times and are suited to different terriors.</li>
<li>Vintage 2019 marks generous amount of sunshine that resulted in fruits with ripe acidity, and a healthy balance. </li>
<li>Vintage 2021 was the most complicated vintage in the last 50 years and Marcel Deiss also lost 60% yield to rains that caused mildews.</li>
<li>Mambourg - limestone that results in wide acidity; Schlossberg - granite that results in vertical wines; Altenberg - clay and limestone, also the only GC in Alsace that allows all 13 varieties; Schoenenerg - clay and gypse (gypsum); Zotzenberg is the only GC that allows Sylvaner; Hengst and Kirchberg de Barr are two GCs for Pinot Noir; Kaefferkopt allows 60-80% Gewurtztraminer, 10-40% Riesling, <30% Pinot Gris, <10% Muscat.</li>
<li>Biodynamic since QQQ. They use pied de cuve for stuck fermentation.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Riquewihr (Schoenenbourg) 2020</span>: On clay soil that is commonly associated with fruiter expressions, as well as limestone. Southeast facing very gentle slopes around the village Riquewihr, a colder site. Over 13 varieties co-planted but the majority are Riesling and Pinot Gris. 14% abv.</li><li>Medium aromatic intensity. Pale straw with salmon hue. Sweet peach, white flowers, minerality, salinity, and apricot. Elevated acidity, and elevated finish on minerality and apricot.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">Berckem (local name of Bergheim) 2019</span>: Colder and sunnier microclimate. Both southeast and southwest facing. Gold hue. Mostly Riesling and Pinot Gris. Very aromatic! Marigold, honeysuckle. Slightly off-dry. Medium acidity, 13.5% abv. Medium finish on marigold.</li>
<li><span style="color:yellow">♥ Langenberg 2019</span>: Pure granite. 3-4km from where the tasting room in Bergheim is. Some call it linear --- one knows exactly where it's heading. Pale straw.

<h5 style="color:red" href="">Bott-Geyl</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Created in 1775 by the marriage of familie Bott and familie Geyl. 99% production is white wines, with one red white and two sparkling wines. </li>
  <li>Produces from 6 varieties (Riesling, Muscat, Gewurtztraminer, Pinot Noir, Pinot Blanc, Pinor Gris) and 6 grand cru sites (Schlossberg, Schonenberg, Mandelberg, Sporen, Furstentum, Snnenglanz).</li>
  <li>Biodynamic since 2000 - one of the first five growers to convert, along with Z-H, Marcel Deiss, Vicent Flheit.</li>
  <li>Long aging in bottle before release. For instance, current release of Pinot Gris GC is 2012. 90k bottles produced per year on average, but around 350k bottles are held in the cellar for extended aging.</li>
  <li>Vifinication is done partly in stainless steel tanks and foudres (half and half). Foudres at the domaine come in all sizes according to the size of the parcels. During the fermentation, vessels are swapped between stainless steel and used oak barrels to keep wines in balance. For instance, if the acidity is too high, the wine would be racked into foudres to round it out.</li>
  <li>Bott-Geyl aims to make wines of terrior and emotions. Organic and biodynamic farming is practiced. Natural sulphr or copper sprays are used for mildews. No chemical products used whatsoever. Sulphur usage is also limited --- a bit in tank after pressing before kicking off fermentation to prevent microbial spoilage.</li>
  <li>Has been experimenting with Syrah in the past few vintages, as Vin de France</li>
  <li>Export 70%.</li>
