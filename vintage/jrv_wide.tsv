2017	Considered one of the best vintages in recent years, with generally warm and dry conditions. Cooler temperatures in the final two months lead to slightly lower alcohols and well preserved acidity. Even so, picking was generally earlier than the previous year, and while yields were higher than the small 2016 crop, volumes were still below the long-term average.	0.98812073469162	The grape harvest started later than in 2016, thanks to a relatively cool and wet start to the year, which brought disease pressure. There were none of the drought problems of recent years, and the crop was plentiful across all of Australia. Dry weather for most the harvest period ensured that quality was generally high too.	0.985922932624817	NA	NA	After severely damaging fires that raged across large areas of southern Chile in early 2017, the grape harvest started early in 2017. A generally warm year has produced ripe fruit flavours which can be jammy in some reds.	0.999521493911743	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Wetter, cooler conditions than usual made for a late harvest with Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc expected to be perhaps more restrained than the norm. Volume was 9% lower than in 2016.	0.00109463930130005	NA	NA	Very good quality potential across the Western Cape, thanks to dry conditions throughout harvest and very little disease pressure. Many regions experienced drought conditions, resulting in a smaller-than-usual crop, but offering greater concentration of both colour and flavour as a result.	0.999272108078003	NA	NA	NA	NA	Better yields than in 2016, though frost damage affected many vineyards in the south-east of England. Sugar levels were good at harvest, thanks to some hot spells in June and a mostly dry harvest period, and acid levels were mostly well-balanced too. Total harvest 4.5 m bottles off 2,275 hectares.	0.997633635997772	NA	NA
2016	A rain- and hail-affected vintage made for unusually challenging conditions. It was also one of the coolest vintages on record, according to Bodega Catena Zapata, which had the advantage of restricting the spread of rot and resulted in atypically modest alcohol levels. Overall, though, yields are lower and quality is by no means reliable. Gualtallary is thought to be one of the regions that escaped the worst impact of the excess precipitation.	0.0156239867210388	Another very early vintage, with most varieties and regions finished with harvest by mid-February. That has allowed for lower alcohols in regions such as Coonawarra, but the warm summer allowed for full flavour ripeness. It was a compressed and difficult vintage to produce, but the results should be promising. For a more detailed report, read Max Allen’s article.	0.993307173252106	Officially described as 'outstanding quality, characterised by particularly delicate fruit-driven aromatics and fresh acidity,' early signs of quality are good. Yields in Steiermark and Burgenland were reduced by frost and hail in April - in the former region by up to 80%. Then a wet summer gave rise to plentiful mildew, although conditions in early autumn were much more favourable and the resultant wines are thought to be of good quality, though not destined for long ageing.	0.999699413776398	An El Niño year generated an unusual amount of rain, especially in Casablanca, Rapel, Maipo and Colchagua. Red varieties were most affected, as the worst of the rain came after most whites had been harvested. The result is a 25% reduction in yield and very variable quality. The only saving grace may be lower alcohol and fresher acidity in the best wines.	0.0361543893814087	Managing to escape the hail and frost that beset other French regions meant that Alsace had good yields in 2016. However, during a wet June mildew was a potential problem, but the rest of summer was warm and dry. Harvest conditions were good, and the resultant wines are more elegant and classic in profile than the richer 2015s.	0.99969869852066	Generally lighter than the top vintages, the best sweet Bordeaux in 2016 are refreshing and zesty but not hugely complex. Noble rot came quite late in the season, and some fruit had already been picked when it arrived. Therefore, some of the wines are characterised by raisined flavours rather than the mushroom and marmalade notes of great botrytised whites.	0.987945139408112	Hail, frost and mildew all made 2016 an extremely difficult year for makers of red burgundy. Yields were universally low, and the fruit had less concentration than in 2015. Beyond that, generalisations are impossible due to the complicated meteorological patterns throughout the year, creating very varied conditions in each sub-region.	0.00251179933547974	As happened widely across France, frost and hail conspired to lower the yields in the Champagne region in 2016. Quality is generally above average, with Pinot Noir preferred to Chardonnay. The vintage is likely to be declared for several luxury cuvées, including Cristal and Comtes de Champagne.	0.679090976715088	Once again, frost caused significant crop loss in the Loire Valley, especially in Muscadet. Quality and concentration is good, with Chenin Blanc being particularly noteworthy in 2016 while Sancerre is thought to be the best of the Sauvignon Blanc appellations. Cabernet Franc is 'delicious, ripe and fruity' according to Loire courtier Chris Hardy.	0.999825239181519	According to Michel Chapoutier, 2016 could be better than 1990 in the southern Rhône – praise indeed. Warm conditions throughout the year along with reduced yields has resulted in wines of great concentration – in colour, tannin and flavour. Certainly one of the great vintages, for reds anyway.	0.999357044696808	The quality of red Bordeaux in 2016 was universally lauded – although the response to the en primeur campaign was muted. Quantity was high too, with the equivalent of 770 million bottles of wine produced. An exceptionally dry summer with cool nights eventually, thanks to mid September rain, resulted in small, thick-skinned, ripe grapes, and the wines are marked by high tannin and acidity, with superb aromatic fragrance.	0.999674916267395	Unlike its red counterparts, dry Bordeaux white was rarely thrilling in 2016. Stylistically, they tend to be slightly lower in alcohol and acidity than the 2015s, with less expressive flavours. By no means a bad vintage for whites, but most certainly better for reds.	0.00316649675369263	Damaging hailstorms and frost meant that yields are down across the region, by as much as 50% in Chablis. However, what remains is considered good quality in a classic style – that is, without any particular extremes of acid, alcohol, body or fruit concentration.	0.986116826534271	Generally warm and sunny throughout the summer with usefully fresh nights, though some regions suffered through lack of rainfall, resulting in smaller yields of concentrated juice. However, these dry conditions did at least result in reduced disease pressure, and quality is generally good across reds and whites, with high flavour intensity.	0.999775350093842	Hail in April damaged some of the crop in Hermitage, meaning yields are reduced – though quality isn’t necessarily compromised. Indeed, there is a lot of enthusiasm for both reds and whites, despite some tricky weather throughout the year. Alcohol levels are in general slightly lower than in 2015.	0.213817298412323	High rainfall in early summer created serious disease pressure, especially in Nahe and Mosel. What with late frost and hail, prospects for the 2016 harvest did not look good. However, the weather improved from July onwards and the overall quality is good, while the wines tend to be lower in alcohol and higher in acidity than 2015.	0.969822347164154	Piemonte produced excellent quality wine in 2016, with ripeness to match the very good 2015 but firmer tannin and higher acidity. Ideal harvest conditions allowed the Nebbiolo to ripen fully, and yields were higher than average too. Arneis also fared well, producing precise, juicy white wines.	0.999682366847992	Another good vintage in Tuscany has produced wines with deep colour and impressive fragrance. However, yields were down by up to a fifth compared to the average. Chianti Classico enjoyed particularly good quality fruit.	0.999702930450439	A welcome increase of volume produced after the small 2015 vintage. Martinborough had excellent weather conditions throughout the year, and is likely to fare better than Central Otago. In Marlborough, larger than average berry size is expected to emphasise thiols (passionfruit flavours) over methoxypyrazines (herbal flavours).	0.999539315700531	A cold and wet spring made for a tough start to the year, and yields were lower than average as a result. Some very hot spells followed, retarding the ripening process as the vines shut down. Thankfully, the autumn was mostly dry, allowing for a long harvest to ensure optimum ripeness and the wines are rich, complex and intense.	0.990313172340393	The smallest crop in half a decade has resulted in concentrated, ripe wines. The hot conditions demanded an early harvest, which means alcohol levels are generally lower than average. Sunburn was a problem in some regions, but there was at least minimal threat of rot thanks to very dry weather throughout the season.	0.100528180599213	Drought conditions throughout the year led to low yields across Catalunya. The small berries have resulted in very high intensity, with local grape varieties generally performing better than international varieties. Quality is good, even if yields were not.	0.999649107456207	Unlike Catalunya, Rioja enjoyed an abundant harvest – the largest since 2005, and many producers had to discard fruit to meet the permitted yield. Quality is excellent, with modest alcohol, full ripeness, relatively light tannins, good aromatic range and no bitterness. In Ribera del Duero, the outlook is also positive, with quality as good as the strong 2015 vintage.	0.999835789203644	Very low yields made things difficult for many producers, but quality was at least generally good. The eastern part of England had the better weather, and ripeness reached record levels in many cases. Total harvest 4.15 m bottles off 2,100 hectares.	0.999091327190399	While Europe suffered from frost and hail, northern California experienced very heavy rainfall in autumn 2016. While that partially relieved the extended drought status of the region, it also caused some flood damage. Cooler than normal temperatures in August allowed for a steady, gradual ripening, which has produced wines of very good complexity, and higher-than-average natural acidity.	0.999137163162231
2015	A tricky year for the main region, Mendoza, with warmth and humidity bringing rot, and hail affecting some areas too. The best producers had to be meticulous in their selection, and lesser wines are likely to suffer from the poor conditions.	0.0270881652832031	Bush fires in the Adelaide Hills area may result in some smoke-tainted wines. Coonawarra had a warm spring but a cooler summer allowing for slow development and notably high tannin in the Cabernet Sauvignon. Barossa Shiraz enjoyed an excellent vintage while Clare Valley growers are enthusiastic about the quality of their Riesling.	0.980902791023254	After the challenges of 2014, the 2015 harvest was far better. It was generally warm across the country, creating flavourful wines from all varieties. Both whites and reds are expected to display strong typicality with fuller-than-average body.	0.999594628810883	A very early harvest after higher-than-average temperatures throughout the seasons translated into lower acidity levels, requiring attentive handling in the winery to achieve balance.	0.0265859961509705	Much easier than recent vintages. After a gloomy June the summer was scorching, resulting in a harvest that began very early in September, and in lower acid levels than usual. Pinot Noir was particularly successful. Healthy harvest conditions allowed many producers to make late-harvested sweet wines. Overall, yield was small for the third year in a row.	0.997956693172455	Botrytis affected vineyards evenly and quickly in-between late autumn rains, resulting in very promising harvests. Quality looks to be very good indeed.	0.99947190284729	Low yields and warm weather allowed for ample ripeness, small berries and an early harvest. Quality is looking extremely fine, with some people whispering comparisons with the outstanding 2005 vintage. Acid levels in individual wines may be crucial.	0.999188959598541	Very little disease pressure, thanks to dry, sunny conditions over the summer months – the driest on record. Rain arrived in the final week of harvest, but most grapes had already been gathered. The berries tended to be small but with good uniform ripeness, and potential alcohol levels were relatively high at harvest. Richness should characterise the vintage, and Pinot Noir did particularly well. Some excellent vintage champagne should be produced.	0.999471187591553	Very promising across the region, with the same warm, dry summer that many other French regions enjoyed. In Muscadet, some rain towards the end of harvest resulted in a little rot, but nothing too concerning. Touraine saw very low yields but excellent quality, as did Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé. Pinot Noir reached full ripeness, and very promising quality, for all those growers prepared to wait. Chenin Blanc also fared well, with the potential to make good wine at all sweetness levels.	0.999715387821198	Grenache suffered from coulure at flowering, meaning lower yields but the quality is extremely promising. Alcohol levels are likely to be higher than in the two previous vintages.	0.999408423900604	Will this vintage adhere to Jancis’ rule of five, whereby any vintage divisible by five is of good quality? It seems so, with particularly healthy, uniform fruit at harvest. A generous flowering and hot, dry early summer was followed by a slighty cooler, damper August. Harvest was generally earlier than in 2014. Optimists are already calling it the best vintage since 2010 with early reports favouring the right bank.	0.999556541442871	Rain in August cased more problems for the thin-skinned Sémillon than Sauvignon Blanc. This is likely to be reflected in the final blends.	0.0722342133522034	An early vintage with a very warm, dry summer. Chablis was affected by hail in early September, damaging 300 hectares of vineyard. Lower acidity levels make the wines richer but less precise than the 2014s.	0.720395445823669	The harvest began on 7 August. The hot weather produced plentiful ripeness, and potential quality is considered to be very promising at the top end.	0.999173045158386	Universally viewed as a vintage with top quality potential. Guigal will produce their special Condrieu cuvée Luminescence for only the third time (previous vintages were 1999 and 2003). For reds, maintaining freshness and avoiding over-extraction is the key to quality with such ripe fruit.	0.999736487865448	Yields across the country met the ten-year average, though they varied from region to region. In the Mosel, for instance, quality is especially promising but yields were 8% down on 2014. The Rheingau is also tipped for excellence, while reds from Baden are expected to be powerful and dark.	0.027718722820282	An exceptional vintage thanks to healthy grapes and exceptionally regular bunches. A very cold winter with plenty of snow and a protracted cool and rainy spring replenished the water tables, much needed during a July that was the hottest ever on record. The vintage shows great promise, even if some grapes were relatively low in acidity.	0.999785363674164	A cold and rainy winter preceded an irregular spring followed by exceptionally hot, dry summer weather, creating small bunches of Sangiovese, so yields were down across the region – exacerbated by several violent August hailstorms – although concentration levels are very good.	0.247038304805756	Marlborough enjoyed a very dry summer, resulting in wines with greater concentration than 2014 and yields were down 20-25%. Central Otago enjoyed plenty of ripeness in the Pinot Noir.	0.202362060546875	Overall, a dry and warm year in the Douro, but with enough rainfall at the right times to keep the vines in good condition. Disease pressure was low and the harvest was earlier than average. Flavour ripeness is impressive across all varieties, but acidity levels are fairly low, as are yields. Most producers are confident of making great vintage ports in this vintage.	0.996557354927063	Record early harvest but viewed as good quality by most observers, thanks to clement weather throughout the year. Yields are slightly lower than in 2014.	0.927042901515961	Priorat and Montsant escaped the harvest rains unscathed in 2015, and producers are very enthused about the quality. Potentially the best harvest of the last five years.	0.999756455421448	Ribera was hot and dry in 2015. Old vines did well while younger vines struggled. Volume was lower than in 2014 by up to one third. Low nitrogen levels led to some struggling ferments, but the flavour ripeness is very high, with soft tannins and high potential alcohol. Alcohol will also be higher than usual in Rioja, again with powerful concentration and richness. A short, early harvest reflected the ripeness of the crop. Berries were small across the region, with the higher, cooler vineyards of Rioja showing especially high quality.	0.999279022216797	A frost-free spring led to a cool spring. Flowering weather was very good, but two weeks late, and with a cool summer, characterised by untypical cool nights, grapes were slow to develop. August and most of September were cooler than average and many growers were despairing of harvesting later varieties. However, a good end to September and an exceptionally warm October saved growers and most picked good yields of healthy grapes. Altogether a very good year for both still and sparkling wines, although Chardonnay based sparkling wines will want long ageing. Total harvest estimated to be 4.5 m bottles off 1,600 hectares.	0.996170043945312	In common with much of Europe, the harvest started early in California – as early as July for some growers of sparkling wine. Yields are almost universally down on 2014. Huge wildfires proved a challenge for many, causing damage to vineyards and property as well as threatening smoke taint, especially in Lake County.	0.0162191987037659
2014	Frost, and January rain made for whites with lighter than usual concentration in 2014, but fine aromatic detail. Reds are similarly fresh and elegant, but are not expected to be hugely long-lasting.	0.99863076210022	Extreme weather conditions are increasingly normal for Australia, and 2014 saw everything from frost to high winds to heatwaves. Yields were lower than usual and while nobody is claiming it is a great vintage, quality is generally reliable across varieties.	0.999593913555145	Excessive rainfall and generally poor weather conditions made this the worst Austrian vintage in recent years.	0.000266313552856445	Widespread frost caused crop loss of up to 70%, but what remained made very good quality wine, showing plenty of concentration and complexity.	0.999673962593079	Cool temperatures throughout August made 2014 a high-acid vintage for Alsace, which bodes especially well for Crémant. Late-harvested whites were not a strong suit, but dry whites exhibit good typicality, albeit in a relatively restrained way.	0.99889749288559	A triumph for Sauternes in this vintage, with some botrytis in September and plenty in late October. Some observers are even calling it the best vintage since the turn of the century.	0.999682307243347	An unusually mild winter (this was the year of the  Asian fruit fly) preceded an unusually early start to the season. Flowering took place in settled conditions and all seemed set fair for a year of good quantity at last, and an early harvest. Except that the summer was miserably cool and wet (and a dramatic hailstorm on 28 June wreaked havoc on the Côte de Beaune for the third year running) so that growers needed every ray of sunshine in a fine September to recoup their losses. Wines are relatively light.	0.99808144569397	Initial reports suggest that a warm, dry September saved the crop from a damper, cooler August. The resulting fruit has good levels of potential alcohol, indicating ample ripeness.	0.999068379402161	Lots of top quality wine was produced from the Loire in 2014. Cabernet Franc is garnering particular praise, but there are some excellent whites made from the Muscadet grape Melon de Bourgogne, Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc (from dry to sweet) too. The only bad news was that, once again, yields were lower than the long-term average.	0.0500686764717102	A relatively light vintage in terms of alcohol and phenolics, even if not in terms of quantity. A mild winter and wet early spring built up water reserves. The growing season started unusually early but a cool, wet summer put on the brakes so in the end the harvest was one of the latest ever and some red wine grapes struggled to reach full ripeness. Sorting was essential.	0.0466374158859253	Exceptionally cool, damp July and August but the vintage was saved by an unusually dry, warm September and October that (just about) ripened the grapes though autumn concentration has resulted in relatively high-acid wines. Reds have fragrance, medium body and supple tannins but are not for long term cellaring.	0.981766104698181	Searing acidity is the hallmark of many of these wines, some of which are exceptionally pleasing. Plenty of others, however, are relatively new creations and remain works in progress.	0.999829649925232	Rather promising wines have emerged from a season that started unusually early after a mild winter and usefully wet early March followed by a very dry spring. Weather during flowering was almost too hot and dry. A cool, damp summer slowed ripening so that a fair quantity of grapes with good acid levels were picked at the usual time.	0.0228091478347778	The Languedoc experienced cataclysmic hail storms in 2014, seriously compromising yield, but the Roussillon fared better and looks to have produced wines of balance, concentration and complexity at relatively low alcohol levels. Early start to the season but a cool, humid summer delayed harvest to average dates. Exceptionally productive Grenache after the coulure of 2013.	0.995261371135712	A challenging growing season for reds in which grapes struggled to reach full maturity and particularly vigilant sorting was required thanks to the Drosophila suzukii fruit fly. A successful flowering resulted in a decent crop, swollen in many cases by rain during the summer and red wine harvest. Whites fared better and benefited from a late rush to maturity but retained good acid levels. Reds likely to be for relatively early drinking.	0.997917652130127	‘Too cold and too wet’ is the general summary for Germany in 2014. Yields were higher than the much smaller preceding vintage, but quality is surmised as 'good, bad and ugly' by Michael Schmidt, with the proviso that the better producers are inevitably the better performers.	0.0191859602928162	The second year in a row when a wet, cool spring followed a very wet winter. Mid May saw temperatures soar, resulting in a regular and quick fruit set that seemed to promise an early harvest and generous yield. But the weather changed to cool and very wet from early July with some violent hailstorms, notably in the commune of Barolo, dashing all hopes of a great vintage. Quality is expected to be irregular, but those who dared to delay harvest were rewarded with a sound, if notably small, crop of Nebbiolo. Likely to be a light year with limited cellaring potential.	0.0711193680763245	A rainy, mild winter was followed by a cool spring, with one exceptional patch of high temperatures causing early budbreak and quick and generous fruit set. But the growing cycle was protracted due to cool weather and frequent hailstorms in July and August, causing widespread downy mildew. An exceptionally mild and dry September and early October turned a potentially disastrous vintage into a surprisingly good one, but with generally much lighter, earlier-ripening wines than 2013.	0.952364802360535	A generally good vintage across the country, with particular excitement in Hawke’s Bay where 2014 is thought of as potentially even better than the outstanding 2013. The country’s viticultural engine room Marlborough had its largest ever vintage, with quality touted as above-average.	0.99979031085968	Rain caused significant damage in the first half of the year, then a cool August didn’t help matters. Yields will be low, quality is not remarkable, and vintage declarations are most unlikely.	0.0515488982200623	A challenging vintage beset by rain. Coastal regions fared better than most, but overall the expectations for quality are not high.	0.0314159989356995	Quite a lot of rot at harvest due to humid conditions. Together with modest temperatures throughout the summer, this is a lighter and fresher vintage – especially when compared with the more typically full 2013s.	0.999191462993622	The official report from Rioja describes the 2014 harvest as improved in quality and quantity compared to 2013, though they acknowledge some grey rot affected the final week of harvest.	0.98174124956131	A dream year for UK vineyards with little frost, very good flowering weather, a cool wet August, but warm September and October. Most growers had very good crops with excellent sugars and acids. Still wines very good and sparklers up to the high quality of 2009. Total harvest 6.32 m bottles off 1,506 hectares.	0.999786972999573	Drought made itself felt in Napa and Sonoma, but ample ripeness led to a relatively early harvest of grapes in good condition and with plenty of flavour. There is a general sense of positivity across most regions and varieties for the potential quality of 2014 in California.	0.999698519706726
2013	Healthy, dry and abundant with a cool spell late in the season prolonging the ripening period for red varieties. Very promising quality across all regions.	0.999860644340515	The hottest summer ever for South Eastern Australia and yields were well down but the vine proved itself relatively resistant to the record temperatures with many varieties ripening in an unusually short period.	0.136240184307098	Very tricky weather conditions, from snow to flooding to drought, made 2013 a tough vintage. Nevertheless, Grüner Veltliner is particularly concentrated, while Riesling is acidic and austere. Reds are juicy and simple, and failed to reach the standard of 2012 and 2011. Very few sweet wines were made.	0.0257014632225037	Cool weather that was better for later ripening varieties - so Carmenère is especially promising. Early ripeners such as Sauvignon Blanc were less good, with unripe characteristics.	0.997776567935944	A stop-start growing season produced a very small crop which, but for harvest rains, would have been perfectly formed. Those that brought in grapes early fared the best.	0.997836709022522	Wildly uneven quality and excruciatingly low yields – but the good ones manage to somehow overcome the adversarial conditions. The top names of Sauternes can be trusted in 2013 in a way that their red counterparts mostly can not.	0.991073966026306	A frigid spring delayed flowering and led to uneven ripening. Producers battled with hail (particularly in the Côte de Beaune) and summer downpours, but, despite the naysaying, a drier September allowed a small crop of balanced fruit with good potential.	0.998662114143372	Pales in comparison to the stellar 2012, with a cool spring leading to uneven ripening and one of the latest harvests in 20 years. Summer hail caused widespread damage in the summer months but overall the champenois fared better than many of their compatriots. Likely a vintage year.	0.827454149723053	An annus horribilis for the producers of Vouvray and Montlouis whose crops were almost entirely wiped out by a June hailstorm. Elsewhere a sound vintage with good acidity, though the cool spring and mild conditions in August and September meant many reds struggled to achieve full ripeness.	0.980053603649139	Coulure was this year’s bugbear for the vignerons of the Southern Rhône, drastically reducing the Grenache crop: 2013 Côtes du Rhône may well be in short supply. As is often the case where low yields are matched by careful selection, overall quality is good.	0.999365627765656	A universally poor vintage, beset by uneven ripening and dilution. Rot forced relatively early picking. Even at their best, the wines are pretty light – though perhaps a benefit of this is lower alcohol levels, as compared with some of the 15% bruisers of recent years. The best of a bad lot can be found in Pomerol, St-Julien and St-Estèphe.	0.0589402318000793	As with the reds in 2013, there is a lightness to Bordeaux’s Sémillon/Sauvignon Blanc blends – though this is not an entirely bad thing.	0.998949408531189	A disappointment to Burgundy’s Chardonnay growers who had hoped for higher volumes than 2012. Instead, a short crop thanks to the cold spring was diminished still further by the careful fruit selection required after an erratic summer. All in all, producers intent on quality have acquitted themselves well.	0.013262927532196	A tricky vintage in the south of France with yields of coulure-afflicted Grenache down 50-60%. Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan fared better and an Indian summer compensated for the cold wet spring, bringing the grapes to full ripeness. Cooler conditions generally resulted in fresher than usual whites from Viognier, Vermentino and Roussanne.	0.994424819946289	Very promising reds which may well have excellent longevity. Despite a slow start and problems with mildew in June, the 2013 growing season came good with fine warm days and cool nights throughout the summer. Rain prompted a speedy harvest (one of the latest ever).	0.999676823616028	A chill spring and fine, mild summer gave way to wet weather in September and October which proved many producers’ undoing. Astute vineyard management was essential to coax grapes to ripeness and avoid rot. Low yields and fair quality across the board.	0.0665074586868286	Incessant rain during winter and spring delayed budbreak and opened the door to fungal diseases, although many vineyards were too waterlogged for tractors. From mid July temperatures shot up and remained high during August, albeit with cooler nights. September was very sunny and dry, but the growing cycle was still two weeks late, necessitating a delayed harvest. The prognosis is for a vintage similar in quality to the already legendary 2010s.	0.0950140953063965	Considered a ‘classic vintage’ due to harvest taking place at the beginning of October. (This used to be the norm but the previous two, much warmer, years brought harvests forward to the beginning of September.) A very cool wet spring delayed budbreak by an average of two weeks. A very wet May that encouraged widespread and continued spraying was followed by a cool June. A picture-perfect July, August and September saved the year, one that resulted in elegant, fresh wines. A promising vintage on the whole, with the wines of Montalcino expected to be exceptional.	0.999665975570679	Slightly riper than 2012 in Marlborough, and 'nigh-on perfect' in much of the north island, especially Hawke's Bay, with a long, warm summer and no adverse weather - although early frosts did bring down yields for many.	0.999622523784637	Unusually cool conditions in April and May and a tinder dry summer slowed grape development resulting in a low-yielding, tardy harvest of generally high quality.	0.0138013958930969	A wet winter and warm summer. Humidity threatened rot during the harvest, but producers with the strongest nerve successfully waited for dryer conditions. Reds are particularly promising.	0.999452650547028	Very healthy fruit at harvest, with lots of promise across the varieties. Good quality, and higher yields than in 2012.	0.999871432781219	Despite a cool, wet start to the year, a long dry summer in Ribera del Duero heralded full fruit ripeness at harvest, with below average temperatures promising fine flavour development. Frequent bouts of wet weather in Rioja, together with the cold spring, resulted in some uneven ripening and a delayed harvest that slipped into November in some parts, yet yields here were slightly up on 2012 and producers are optimistic.	0.99811977148056	An early frost-free spring then led to a cool spell with very good, but very late, flowering weather. Grapes developed slowly with one of the latest harvests on record in modern times. Some growers still picking in mid-November. Not a great year for still wines and sparklers will be long-lived. Total harvest 4.45 m bottles off 1,571 hectares.	0.0297171473503113	A very fine vintage on the West Coast with optimal weather conditions throughout the growing season. The second high-quality bumper crop in a row.	0.99975860118866
2012	Similar to 2011, but with lower yields leading to higher colour, fruit intensity and notable tannin that will require many years of bottle age to resolve.	0.387726783752441	Lower-than-average yields in Australia, as across much of Europe. This was blamed on high winds, drought and low fruitfulness resulting from the poor 2011 vintage. Quality, however, was much better than in the exceptionally damp 2011, with South Australia avoiding some of the weather extremes experienced by other states. Strong varietal typicality is a commonly cited feature of the 2012 crop.	0.386661887168884	May frost restricted yields in 2012, but the rest of the season was more favourable, and quality is good. Very generally speaking, Grüner Veltliner did better than Riesling, although health was good across all varieties. Reds are lower in alcohol and concentration than the much better 2011 vintage.	0.997955560684204	A cool vintage, thanks to La Niña. Grapes were universally healthy at harvest, and yields were up to 18% higher than average. Quality is good, with impressive varietal typicality.	0.999860405921936	2012 went well for the Alsatians. Volumes were roughly average, and quality was very pleasing, thanks to a warm, steady August and a cool, dry September that kept vineyards disease-free. The Crémants, Pinots Noir and Gris, and Gewurztraminers are all especially successful.	0.999871611595154	Will not be remembered fondly by the Sauternais. Headlines were made when Yquem, Rieussec, Suduiraut and Raymond-Lafon announced they would not be making any grand vin. The Barsac region had slightly better conditions, but nobody is pretending this will be a sought-after vintage.	0.534554779529572	Blighted by rot, as a damp summer across Europe made conditions hard for vignerons, with mildew a particular problem. The weather was erratic and bizarre, with heatwaves, hail, a cold spring, thunderstorms and all manner of meteorological mischief. The net results are very low volumes of variable quality – but overall vignerons are surprised and delighted by what resulted. One hallmark of 2012 looks to be soft tannins.	0.993902802467346	An exceptional vintage in Champagne. Despite low yields thanks to frost, hail and disease early in the season, August saw conditions improve dramatically resulting in exemplary maturity, acidity and grape health at harvest.	0.99975723028183	Despite a challenging growing season, 2012 was the year that Muscadet really shone, producing some of the best examples ever. Yields were around half the average, however. Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé fared better for whites and reds, with good, uniform ripeness, no rot, and yield in line with the norm. Delayed flowering early in the season proved tricky for Cabernet Franc, because autumnal rains made for diluted fruit as growers waited for ripeness. There were very few botrytised Chenins made in Anjou, Vouvray and Montlouis, but dry wines are promising in a lighter style.	0.99940437078476	Much more successful than 2011. It was a low-acid year in both the northern and southern Rhône. Alcohols are roughly average, but volumes are down by up to 15% on 2011. Clement weather late in the season made for relaxed harvesting however, and vignerons are optimistic about the results which seem to combine ripeness with some freshness.	0.997946858406067	Tricky across many European wine regions, and none more so than Bordeaux. Generally speaking, it was a wet, late year with a hot mid-summer. Bad weather in October compromised quality at the crucial moment, meaning that the earlier-ripening Merlot-based reds were less adversely affected. Making good Cabernet-based wine was achievable, but only by those who had the resources for micro-management in the vineyard. Top properties made small quantities of outstanding wines but most have a lack of depth and persistence.	0.0114055275917053	Far better for dry whites than their sweet siblings – in fact, they are one of the notable successes of the vintage. Pessac-Léognan and Graves are both good, with more ‘liveliness’ than the average vintage.	0.999864220619202	Produced very low volumes of Chardonnay in Burgundy. What there is, however, is being welcomed with cautious enthusiasm. As with the reds, poor quality was expected after such challenging weather conditions, but the first tastings indicated the wines are very good. A triumph against adversity, perhaps?	0.99940812587738	Described as the worst the Languedoc has seen for 22 years. Yields were low thanks to drought at one stage and mildew at another. Late, uneven ripening resulted in wines without fully developed varietal character in many instances. It certainly was not a complete disaster but overall the feeling is one of disappointment.	0.000408411026000977	Looks good for the Rhône, against the trend of the year in Europe at large. It is defined by lower than average potential alcohol – indeed some chaptalisation was practised. Acidities are also generally below the norm, while tannins are more pronounced than in 2011.	0.0111432075500488	A cool, wet summer in Germany, saved by late warmth in September and October. Yields were overall in line with long term averages, although the Mosel lost up to 25% of its crop. Quality is widely agreed to be very good indeed, and possibly the best vintage in recent memory for Spätburgunder. Dry Rieslings are excellent too, but noble sweet wines are in even smaller supply than usual.	0.999519467353821	An unusually hot summer unexpectedly resulted in Nebbiolos with low alcohol levels and high acidity. A very cold February with an abundance of snow helped to replenish water tables. Prolonged cool weather, well into April, protracted budbreak by two weeks. The weather became more regular, with a warm July, only to be interrupted by several hailstorms destroying the crop in several vineyards in Novello. August turned out to be exceptionally hot with temperatures rising well above 40 ºC, causing vines to shut down and halting the growing cycle. Rain at the end of August cooled things down and restarted (slow) ripening. A dry autumn allowed a delayed harvest. The best wines show acidic nerve, balance and freshness. Overall a light vintage but with several excellent wines on the top level.	0.0969018340110779	An unusually mild winter ended with a very cold February with lots of snow that replenished water tables. Spring was more or less regular with a warm and dry June, while temperatures climbed relentlessly during July and August. Just when producers feared a repeat of the scorching 2011, and vines had but all shut down, the rain that fell at the very end of August reignited growth and ripening. In spite of the intense heat, 2012 resulted in medium-bodied, fresh and at times rather light wines, arguably a welcome change from the heavy and sometimes alcoholic 2011s.	0.99896252155304	One of the coolest years on record, and an overall yield 18% below the norm. This resulted in Sauvignon Blancs with grass and citrus flavours instead of tropical fruit.	0.963264346122742	The Douro saw drought and hail conspire to reduce yields significantly, by as much as 40% in places. The resultant small berries have made wines of high colour and notable acidity.	0.998015463352203	Below average yields, but good quality fruit thanks to a dry, easy harvest period.	0.99942809343338	Greater elegance than 2011, with Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon thriving in the warm, dry conditions. Yields were down by up to 25% in some areas, however.	0.989545702934265	A weird year of weather in Spain. It was the fifth consecutive small vintage, thanks in large part to very dry conditions. The resultant small berries harvested in Rioja are likely to make wines of great concentration and high tannin. The Ribera del Duero crop was also shrunk by drought but producers there are a little more optimistic about eventual quality.	0.987773597240448	A year best forgotten for many growers. Really bad flowering weather and high disease pressures saw some growers (but by no means all) pick nothing. However, those wines that were produced are of good quality. Total yield 1.03 m bottles off 1,297 hectares. Lowest average yield ever recorded.	0.980654418468475	A banner year, providing a useful exception to the short crops experienced so widely elsewhere. Ideal growing conditions seem likely to have produced the best vintage for decades. Virtually all varieties seem to have thrived. Quality with quantity at last.	0.999705791473389
2011	A generally cool, damp year in Argentina. Frost and hail caused some damage too, so careful selection was required to produce the best wines. On the plus side, the coolness made for particular aromatic intensity in white wines.	0.998901009559631	Wet across most of Australia, and 'one of the toughest in 25 years' according to Peter Gago of Penfolds, with lots of botrytis and mildew infections. Whites are generally thought better, with some excellent Clare Valley Riesling where fruit selection was stringent.	0.0692140460014343	Generous yields were welcome following several lean years. Hot weather caused resulted in relatively high alcohol levels, while acidity levels are low. Whites tend to be full bodied with good ageing potential and all red varieties fared well, with some declaring this vintage the best thus far for Austrian red.	0.9997678399086	Another cool year, with many whites recording very low alcohol levels. Elegance and balance are keywords, in a similar style to 2010.	0.998014569282532	Good quality in an early-maturing, drinkable style - but not so impressive as 2010 or the superior 2009s.	0.993838667869568	Where red Bordeaux failed, Sauternes triumphed in 2011, giving opulent, rich, fresh wines of excellent quality.	0.999841332435608	Disappointing quality with widespread rot and uneven weather conditions throughout the year. The results can be surprisingly good in parts, but 2010 is a much safer bet.	0.558902561664581	Notable for its erratic growing season, which started warm and dry but then became cooler and wetter in June and July. Conditions improved briefly in August but the (early) harvest was problematic.	0.00641626119613647	Pretty rotten. Muscadet and Touraine were both blighted with fungal disease. Cabernet Franc only flourished in the best sites and with suitable selection. Chenin Blanc had a much better year, with Anjou and Coteaux du Layon being particularly impressive.	0.940919578075409	Reasonably good quality and good yields, but won't be as brilliant as the preceding two vintages. Often drying tannins.	0.98590475320816	Generalisations are difficult in this variable year, but there is agreement that quality is back down to earth after the excitement of 2009 and 2010, with lower alcohol and generally higher tannins too. A forgettable year.	0.0134472846984863	Some real energy and excitement in dry whites.	0.998763501644135	Less ripe than the previous two vintages, needing chaptalisation in many cases. Chaotic weather made this a tricky vintage overall.	0.00723928213119507	A rainier year meant that volumes were finally back to normal after three lean years - however, it also created a problem with rot in the vineyards. A difficult year but one that has produced some very well balanced, successful reds.	0.999536037445068	Untimely rain in early September diluted what was otherwise a very promising crop. Quality still good, but certainly not at the level of 2010 or 2009.	0.353802084922791	Extremely good quality, with yields back at average after two more depressed years. There is palpable excitement about these wines, with top quality examples across the board from trocken Riesling and Spätburgunder and record-breaking noble whites.	0.999822616577148	A very hot year which has nevertheless resulted in some very good, supple, ripe but not stewed wines, even if at times the higher alcohol (15% and sometimes more) make some of them unbalanced. A very warm April set expectations for a harvest a full four weeks earlier than usual. A distinctly cool June and July slowed the growing cycle down considerably, but August was so hot that Dolcetto raisined on the vine. Rain at the beginning of September accelerated ripening again. Cool nights saved Nebbiolo from overripeness, yet harvest was still a full two weeks earlier than the norm.	0.810452401638031	An exceptionally hot vintage with a very irregular weather pattern. A very cold and snowy winter preceded an unusually warm beginning of spring, although budbreak was not much earlier than normal. April was very hot, followed by a cool May. This pattern of alternating cold and hot periods had a ‘stop-go’ effect on the growth of the vines. The middle of August brought record-breaking heat and the grapes seemed prematurely ready, with some producers picking at the end of August to rescue the fruit from the burning sun. September remained extremely warm and 2011 was the year in which the sorting table arrived en masse in Chianti Classico. Many wines are rich, but fortunately still have enough freshness, although it is doubtful that this will remain during prolonged bottle ageing.	0.99381297826767	Warm and ripe across New Zealand, with a bumper crop of grapes.	0.999859929084778	The rain of 2010 was crucial in this much drier year, to sustain the vines through a hot summer. There was, finally, much needed precipitation in late August and September with dry, warm conditions thereafter which were perfect for picking. Looks to be a great quality vintage.	0.999567091464996	Drought, resulting in reduced yields and particular concentration in reds. Not an auspicious vintage.	0.00030982494354248	Very hot throughout August and September, creating some dehydration. Immensely powerful wines with a great deal of flesh.	0.999836087226868	Hot and heat-stressed for the vines in Rioja with lower acidity than average but powerful, concentrated wines of good quality. Similarly hot in Ribera del Duero, giving very powerful intensity and smooth, soft tannins.	0.999774158000946	Poor flowering with widespread _millerandage_ especially on Pinots saw some growers struggling. Fair quality, but not the greatest. Total vintage 3.02 m bottles off 1,208 hectares.	0.00310128927230835	Miserable conditions made for a very challenging harvest, with mildew and botrytis rife in Napa and Sonoma. Volumes are therefore low for the second consecutive year, with the best quality only found where growers managed to pick ripe fruit before the rainstorms in October.	0.00163990259170532
2010	Reds have slightly lower than average alcohol, thanks to a cool ripening season. Fruit was harvested in good health, but quality was not as good as the exceptional 2009s.	0.0177469849586487	This was the year that the rain finally came, breaking a long drought. This brought some problems later in the season, with excess rainfall encouraging some mildew, but generally the impression is a positive one across the state.	0.998678624629974	A challenging vintage, with cold, wet conditions throughout spring and summer. Yields were way below national average too. One to avoid?	0.00650399923324585	The year of the earthquake, which struck Maule and Curicó on February 27. Mercifully, the growing season was already late, allowing producers to recover as best they could in time for harvest. Overall it was a cool year, best suited to varieties such as Sauvignon Blanc, Syrah, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.	0.986247837543488	Lower yields than 2009, by about 20% overall. Quality is heterogenous thanks to some chaotic weather patterns, meaning that selectivity is the key to finding the best wines.	0.997492611408234	Botrytis was late and irregular this year, giving more delicate and restrained styles than in 2009 and featuring generally lower residual sugar with higher acidity.	0.0817503333091736	A return to the high acid norm after 2009, and some very good quality - especially in the Côte de Nuits - but volumes up to a third lower than average.	0.0443596839904785	A taxing year with dry conditions retarding grape development early in the season. When rain arrived in August it was torrential, causing widespread disease pressure. The return of dry conditions in September helped some producers over the line, but sorting in the vineyard and winery was crucial.	0.484902322292328	Good ripeness and concentration for Muscadet. Delightful Sauvignons too with good concentration and freshness. Late September rain created a bit of rot for the Cabernet Franc, with only the bravest growers waiting for full ripeness to occur – which it did, thanks to two lucky weeks of late sunshine. Chenins fared better in Cotreux du Layon than Vouvray, with the full range of sweetness being made.	0.999005198478699	A very successful vintage, with precision and freshness allowing great expression of terroir. Equally outstanding for whites and reds. Excellent.	0.999883830547333	Another stellar vintage, with higher tannin and more freshness than 2009 but comparable intensity. More appealing to classical palates.	0.999773919582367	Tremendous quality, combining the best weight of the 2009s with the lively freshness of the 2008s.	0.999872326850891	High acidity, after the more opulent style of the 2009s. A small, ripe crop - although a storm in early September did produce some rot, so sorting was crucial - as ever.	0.342934608459473	Quantity is down - again - but quality is good, with minimal rot thanks to dry, windy conditions in August and September.	0.998610734939575	Low yields of exceptionally good quality. One of the very best years in the northern Rhône - possibly the best in history!	0.999647915363312	A tricky, high-acid vintage, with low sunshine and high rain. Despite this, July was extremely hot, skewing the average temperature to well above average. Yields were devastated, but Riesling quality is nonetheless promising when in expert hands.	0.999127626419067	A wet spring caused irregular fruit set and was followed by an early summer with lots of rain. While Dolcetto suffered most from the short, cool growing season, Nebbiolo proved resilient thanks to its small berries and thick skins. August proved hot, but cool nights helped retain acidity. Some cooling rain in early September ensured a slow but steady development in the berries. Irregular fruit set meant that some producers had to do a severe selection during harvest, but the overall result is considered outstanding: a classic vintage with plenty of acidity, firm but ripe tannins and near-perfect balance in many wines.	0.999574184417725	Much cooler than the hot 2009. A very wet winter continuing into a very wet spring was followed by a cool growing cycle. The heat that came in July helped to reduce the delay in ripening that was by then an estimated 15 days behind schedule. Sangiovese was harvested as late as the third week of October and many producers had to do several pickings to obtain regularly ripe grapes in the fermentation tanks. Montalcino, exceptionally, was drier than other parts of Tuscany and the long and slow ripening of the grapes resulted in what is considered an outstanding vintage with true ageing potential for years to come.	0.995511651039124	Only produced 75% of average yields, but a very easy vintage otherwise. Sauvignon Blanc experienced particular concentration, while Pinot Noir was praised for its perfume and firm structure.	0.998132109642029	An exceptionally wet winter brought challenging erosion to the Douro, but welcome restoration of ground water. A very hot July then retarded ripening (because the vines shut down in the excessive temperatures) but the weather was more agreeable later in the season with good conditions for harvest and increased yields compared to 2008 and	0.994751572608948	Cool and dry in spring until a very wet November. December was dry again, and warm too, allowing for good late ripening. Mildew was a problem in many areas, so quality is variable.	0.987324714660645	Hot in early summer, becoming cooler toward the end, allowing slow and gradual ripening into autumn. Alcohol levels are rather lower than usual. Reds are better than whites.	0.856161057949066	Exceptional for Ribera del Duero with no excessive weather patterns, uniform ripeness and quality as promising as 2004. Good quality in Rioja also, considered better than 2009.	0.999788641929626	Ideal flowering conditions and a warm summer saw another early harvest with some growers having to pick Pinots early as sugars were getting too high. A very good year for both still and sparkling wines. Total vintage 4.05 m bottles off 1,095 hectares.	0.999705791473389	A very cool start to the season, then sudden heat in August followed by torrential rain. The net result is greatly reduced yields, but some very good quality wines in a more restrained, higher acidity and lower alcohol style than the Californian norm.	0.997909307479858
2009	For some, one of the best vintages of the decade in Mendoza. Winter was mild, spring was dry and summer was warm, with diurnal variation of over 15 ºC (27 ºF). Weather throughout harvest was very dry too, giving fruit in great condition.	0.998415410518646	A smaller vintage with another blistering heatwave to contend with. Opposite to 2008, the whites suffered most in 2009.	0.00545299053192139	NA	NA	Warm and healthy for whites, with Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay both achieving good quality levels. Certain red varieties suffered from dehydration again - Merlot most notably - and alcohol levels were high.	0.999815285205841	This year produced some of the most consistently healthy grapes ever in Alsace, translating into exemplary varietal character throughout the region.	0.999794244766235	Tremendous conditions for the sweet wines; plenty of heat and humidity at the right time have made fantastically rich and concentrated examples, with plenty of complexity and promise.	0.999885976314545	Finally, the Burgundians enjoyed a comparatively dry growing season with consistent warmth and no early season hail damage. Low acidity and ripe tannins should make these reds drinkable early.	0.974490165710449	After early complications a superb summer produced a clean crop of high quality, with particularly good Pinot Noir from the Montagne de Reims. Wines are plump and approachable.	0.999827861785889	A great vintage. Healthy fruit in Muscadet produced superb quality, especially from those growers prepared to keep yields under control. Touraine Sauvignon Blanc performed similarly well, with full phenolic ripeness and very little chaptalisation requirement, if any. Yields were slightly reduced in Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé, and some July hail decimated much of Quincy, Reuilly and Coteaux du Giennois - but what was produced is excellent. Cabernet Franc enjoyed a late, dry harvest to make fully ripe reds, and Chenin was also very promising, although there botrytis was scarce.	0.999734699726105	Hot and dry throughout August, but decent levels of rainfall too, and plenty of wind to keep the vines healthy. Very satisfactory quality fruit at harvest. Impressive. Sometimes over-alcoholic.	0.999652326107025	'Vintage of the decade/century'? This growing season seemed to have it all. A long, fine, warm summer but, crucially, with refreshing nights to help retain acidity. Dramatically ripe, voluptuous wines, especially on the left bank.	0.999657809734344	Warm conditions led to full and fleshy whites with high alcohol but sufficiently balanced acidity, in most cases. Yields for Sauvignon Blanc were a bit lower than for Sémillon, compounded by severe hail in Entre-Deux-Mers and Graves, leading to some supply shortages.	0.187848746776581	Good, healthy and high quality across the region. Warm conditions and fairly large yields have given balanced grapes, and most agree 2009 whites are at least on a par with 2005.	0.999856173992157	A warm and smaller than average year, especially for whites. Quality is very high quality across the region.	0.999841570854187	Warmer and drier than average: volumes were down and harvest was early. Ripening was quick but complete, and quality looks to be very good.	0.9995978474617	Amongst the greatest vintages, 2009 is proving very alluring at a very early stage. The growing season was dry, warm and reliable. The wines are ripe and appealing but 12% down on volume compared to 2008.	0.999663889408112	A cold winter with lots of rain and snow delayed the start of the growing cycle. An unusually warm spring, however, encouraged a rapid budbreak and regular fruit set. It was still warm in June but a wet July increased fungal pressure in the vineyards and reduced yields in some cases. August was extremely hot and dry and the weather remained like this until mid September. The lack of rain caused water stress and vines to shut down. All this let to wildly irregular weather patterns throughout the region with some Barbera being picked before the early-ripening Dolcetto. Malic acid levels were overall below average, while the tannins did not always ripen fully. Quality is irregular, with excellence next to mediocrity, but hardly any of the wines show the stewed and dried-fruit flavours of the equally torrid 2003 vintage.	0.00279521942138672	Initially hailed as a great vintage but the wines, rich and at times jammy with high alcohol, have begun to betray the exceptionally hot summer as they develop in bottle. A very wet winter was followed by a regular spring with a very hot May, with temperatures up to 30 ºC, resulting in a swift flowering and fruit set. The vintage looked to be 10 days earlier than normal, until mid May brought 30 solid days of rain. August was extremely hot with day temperatures reaching 40 ºC, although nights were much cooler than in 2003, which helped to preserve the freshness in the grapes. While the 2009s overall showed richness of fruit with good acidity, in many cases a certain jamminess looks likely to affect their ageing ability.	0.991778314113617	Good quality throughout New Zealand, with dry conditions making for lovely, healthy, naturally balanced wines. Reds from Martinborough and Hawke's Bay were especially noteworthy.	0.999880790710449	An exceptionally hot summer led to an early vintage with great potential for Port, but extremely high alcohols in the unfortified wines, with some unripe tannins and shrivelled berries. Higher altitude sites will be crucial to making these wines work. A declared vintage.	0.996488749980927	Universal acclaim across all varieties.	0.999889850616455	NA	NA	Very hot conditions gave average temperatures above the infamous 2003 vintage. However, timely rains in Rioja and Ribera del Duero relieved the vines and rescued the vintage. Very good quality.	0.999801635742188	Very little spring frost, perfect flowering weather, rain at the right time and warm dry weather at the end of the season resulted in an early harvest with high sugars and balanced acids. Great year for both still and sparkling wines. Total vintage 3.18 m bottles off 946 hectares.	0.999708771705627	Good initial impressions of the fruit, with widespread reports of awesomeness, according to the winemakers, despite a very rainy end to the growing season giving rot problems to many.	0.999578297138214
2008	A very cold winter, a warm spring and a wetter than average autumn. Generally underpowered as a vintage, although reds were marginally better than whites.	0.963662445545197	An extremely hot year wreaked havoc with reds, but the earlier picked whites look to be good quality, and the Barossa’s oldest vines weathered the heat as they always have done.	0.987070322036743	NA	NA	A very cold and long winter, leading to considerable frost damage. Summer was then very hot and dry, leading to widespread drought. Dehydration was a problem, especially in Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.	0.00264370441436768	Challenging weather conditions looked ominous for Alsace this year, but the wines have turned out to enjoy good concentration with balancing high acidity. Quality is not as high as the 2007 vintage. The Crémants are amongst the best.	0.999556958675385	A pretty ignoble year for noble sweeties, unfortunately: yields were devastated by April frost. The pittance that remained, however, was high quality with plenty of botrytis influence.	0.997856438159943	An accursed vintage in Burgundy, with _coulure_, mildew and hail all conspiring to damage yields and quality. Late September sunshine went some way to rescue the crop, however, although high acidity remains the hallmark of this vintage.	0.0119428634643555	Initially a difficult, damp year with widespread mildew; drier conditions in August and a fine, warm September proved many producers’ saving grace. Classically styled wines with fresh acidity balanced by sound ripeness achieved late in the season.	0.999774158000946	A bad start to the growing year – cold and wet in early summer – with a dry but still cool July and August. Frost in Muscadet devastated yields, making for a very hard year for all growers. Sauvignon across the Loire experienced lower yields too, but displays good varietal typicality.	0.974940180778503	Quite gutless reds, thanks to the rain, although whites are worth a look.	0.0524124503135681	Another ungenerous summer saved by some better weather at the end of the season. Yet again, those properties at the top of the tree managed to field enough good fruit to salvage some pretty impressive grand vin but life was increasingly tough lower down the food chain.	0.00536346435546875	A cool growing season with late autumn sunshine gave well balanced whites to Bordeaux in 2008, with pure aromatic qualities and a steely austerity. Volume was affected by some hail and frost.	0.999714910984039	Challenging climatic conditions abounded throughout the season, leading to high acidity that gives these whites a particular freshness. Challenging, then, but as ever the best producers have made some spectacular wines.	0.99982887506485	Variable weather and drought in the summer made this a challenging year, but has created some concentrated, fruity and aromatic reds.	0.999371528625488	Lots of rain gave a disappointing and dilute vintage. Some producers opted not to make their top wines at all. Largely best to avoid.	0.00168895721435547	A very late-ripening vintage marked by cool autumn temperatures. Acidities are therefore high, and only the best-exposed sites produced truly great wines. Very few botrytis wines were made, but there was a reasonable crop of Eiswein.	0.996591150760651	Overshadowed by the plush 2007 wines from a hot vintage, 2008’s austerity was not immediately recognised as the stuff great vintages are made of. Although not without challenges to the growers, a long and cool growing cycle resulted in healthy, thick-skinned Nebbiolo grapes full of extract and high sugar levels, balanced by great acidity. Although in most cases the tannins are still unyielding, these powerful wines have all the ingredients for a significant gain in complexity and depth over years to come.	0.998281240463257	A relatively cool year with high diurnal temperature differences resulting in wines generally high in acidity and with firm tannins. The heterogeneity of finished wines suggests that this is a vintage in which the best terroirs shine. This seems to be true of Chianti Classico too, where the 2007s were initially considered greater. However, the best 2008s, especially the truly serious Riservas, should prove to have complexity as well staying power.	0.99934709072113	A lot of rot in Marlborough, meaning careful selection was required to make good Sauvignon Blanc. Not a distinguished vintage.	0.000355422496795654	A dry but, like 2007, cool year. Some growers picked early for fear of rain, but those that risked it were rewarded with ideal ripening conditions late in the season. Not universally declared, although Quinta do Noval have.	0.998857915401459	Lighter than average wines, thanks to an especially cool growing season. Not an easy vintage, but the slow ripening process led to elegant examples from the best producers.	0.999771952629089	NA	NA	Very good quality for Rioja, with favourable weather throughout autumn. In Ribera del Duero, temperatures were cooler than normal, giving a slow, balanced ripening process and elegant wines as a result.	0.999820590019226	NA	NA	Sonoma’s earliest harvest, and very early throughout northern California.	0.996748447418213
2007	Good for white, but difficult for reds in Mendoza, with excessive heat leading to below optimal freshness in the wines. Salta did better, with Torrontés faring especially well. For a very detailed report, see our _full report on 2007 in Argentina._	0.857609391212463	Very early, very small harvest, shrunk by the killer combination of frost and drought. Reds tend to be concentrated. Clare Rieslings are likely to shine. For a full, very highly detailed, report on 2007, click here.	0.999076366424561	NA	NA	Harvested roughly 10% less than usual. White varieties had good natural balance, and there was little call for acidification. Reds were moderately lighter in alcohol than average, with high acidity giving a particularly fresh style. For a more detailed analysis of this vintage, click here.	0.997961401939392	Very good vintage, even earlier than 2003, with extremely healthy, ripe grapes.	0.999845921993256	Complicated year requiring great precision with both picking schedules and selection. The top properties succeeded yet again.	0.999447166919708	A dank summer led to rotten Pinot Noir grapes and the need for extremely strict selection. The vintage is unlikely to notch up record scores.	0.000407636165618896	An unusually warm spring led to early flowering and optimism which soon gave way to disappointment with one of the murkiest summers on record. Conditions improved towards September allowing a fair crop, with Chardonnay outperforming the Pinots. Above average acidities.	0.971246004104614	Early flowering then a cool, wet summer led to a very uneven vintage, although a dry, warm September helped rescue quality. Even so, rot was a problem and required meticulous selection to avoid. Despite that, results were surprisingly good, with dry whites from all varieties performing especially well.	0.998826324939728	Very wet spring but the region had a much drier summer than most of the rest of France. Wines and tannins are very ripe.	0.999678730964661	An extremely difficult year for growers, with rampant mildew, not enough sun, too much rain until September. Thanks to an arsenal of modern techniques, not least rigorous selection, those who could afford it managed to make attractive wines for relatively early drinking but high prices left the primeur market as flat as a pancake.	0.00246334075927734	The season’s low temperatures benefited these dry whites, as in 2006. With white winemaking improving each year, dry whites were Bordeaux’s real triumph in 2007.	0.99970144033432	Another challenging summer with no shortage of rain but for once Chardonnay flowered after Pinot Noir and was more reliably saved by the drying winds that arrived in late August. Crisper whites than in 2005 and 2006.	0.991411328315735	Very cool, grey summer left grapes struggling to ripen properly.	0.0389201045036316	Very wet spring, a patchy summer but the vintage was saved by decent weather in September.	0.992964446544647	Unusual vintage during which a hot April and record early flowering was followed by a very cool summer but then the grapes were ripened, after a suitably extended growing season, by a very fine autumn. A distinct shortage of Kabinett.	0.106360137462616	Hail and arid conditions resulted in a low-yielding year, but of good quality fruit.	0.998369038105011	Tremendous: high alcohol and good acidity with consistent ripening, after a worryingly erratic budburst. Especially good for Chianti and Montalcino, and for Cabernet Sauvignon in Bolgheri.	0.999774754047394	Unkind to Martinborough, which suffered frost damage, but was welcomed across every other region as being good if not outstanding quality. For a much more detailed report of 2007 in New Zealand, click here.	0.999190866947174	A vintage year, and one that has produced exceptionally approachable Ports at a young age. The growing season was fairly cool for the Douro, leading to later than usual harvest and none of the grape desiccation that can confer raisined character.	0.948486685752869	Ripe and rich, favouring Rhône varieties in particular. For a more detailed breakdown of 2007 in South Africa, click here.	0.999661386013031	NA	NA	After a miserable summer, frost on 24 September decimated the crop from many young Ribera del Duero vineyards. Most grapes struggled to ripen but late pickers were rewarded. Not a stellar year though.	0.0158390402793884	NA	NA	Harvest began early, mid August in the warmer regions, then a cool September slowed ripening to a crawl, allowing physiological maturity to catch up with sugars. October warmed up, and most had their grapes in before late-October rains. Elegant, balanced wines. Yields down 15 to 25%.	0.865350186824799
2006	A very good vintage, making reds with freshness and plenty of body and fruit power. Excellent quality.	0.999885857105255	Rain, very welcome in some respects, interrupted harvest at the end of the fourth successive drought-affected growing season. Limestone Coast Cabernets look promising.	0.997519671916962	NA	NA	Moderately cooler than 2005, and generally healthy in the vineyard at harvest time. Rounded, balanced tannins with modest concentration made reds better for short or medium term cellaring, but not long term.	0.99891585111618	Firm wines slightly lacking flesh.	0.00152128934860229	Not that much botrytis influence.	0.00038611888885498	Poor summer with vine health problems produced wines which at their best are very pure and expressive and at their worst just a bit too austere for comfort.	0.0503867268562317	An exceptionally hot and sunny June and July with grapes in fine fettle but a dank August left producers fearful of underripeness. Fortunately, warm, bright conditions in September redressed the balance. Wines are supple and expressive.	0.99798595905304	Very difficult: a July heatwave was followed by cold, wet weather for the rest of the season. Not a write-off, but certainly not a good year.	0.000703871250152588	Some very lusciously fruited wines that may not last as long as the 2005s but should provide much drinking pleasure in the medium term.	0.998642265796661	This stop-start vintage suffered inevitably by comparison with 2005, although it produced some well-made wines which looked even better in comparison with the 2007s. Drought and high temperatures were the dominant characteristics until the end of July but August was unusually cool and wet and harvest was interrupted by rain. Pauillac and Pomerol seemed to perform best in a year that can taste pretty crisp.	0.0700098872184753	The cool August preserved acid levels and fruit in these wines, which deserve serious attention.	0.998342394828796	Poor summer was followed by much-needed fine weather in early September producing a relatively consistent crop of early-maturing, quite fleshy whites.	0.999134182929993	Relatively soft wines for medium-term drinking.	0.98383355140686	Very promising. As elsewhere in France, the region experienced a very mixed August but a warm September seems to have resulted in an excitingly high success rate.	0.99983412027359	A less than glorious summer and autumn rain bounced many growers into picking earlier than they would have liked, as rampant rot threatened. Very careful selection was needed and it is even more important than usual to stick to the top producers.	0.966731071472168	A coolish summer was followed by an Indian summer punctuated by two bouts of rain but the grapes were healthy enough to withstand them. Promising.	0.999540627002716	Very promising vintage with a steady, prolonged growing season and well balanced wines.	0.999872982501984	Good Sauvignon Blanc, but was more notable for Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah based wines that benefited from the warm and dry weather.	0.999382078647614	A wet year with rain inconveniently timed in September. But some grapes were also shrivelled by extreme heat. Far from a textbook year.	0.0187321901321411	Started coolly, meaning small berries with thick skins that led to great concentration. A strong vintage.	0.999800264835358	NA	NA	Some spring hail in Rioja. Hot summer with some drought stress. Has not lived up to the two previous vintages.	0.00225973129272461	NA	NA	An unusually cool, wet growing season forced growers to drop substantial quantities of rotten fruit and pushed the harvest back to November. Far from a banner year, though the fruits of strict selection may surprise us.	0.00943994522094727
2005	Cool weather meaning a lighter, more aromatic style of wine. The long, dry autumn allowed for extended ripening, which allowed for good natural balance.	0.999102652072906	Large crop of super-ripe wines in which both reds and whites were very successful.	0.99972015619278	NA	NA	Outstanding, with a long growing season and mild temperatures. Quality was much admired across all varieties and regions (although some Chardonnay in Casablanca suffered from moderate rot).	0.999840259552002	Pure, expressive, well balanced wines with good ripeness.	0.999868750572205	No shortage of noble rot and almost as much sweetness as 2003 though not quite so much finesse as 2001.	0.978161573410034	As in Bordeaux, a quite exceptionally good vintage, although many wines may go through a prolonged stage of chewy adolescence.	0.99978244304657	Variable conditions throughout the year resulted in a lackluster vintage, though favourable weather in the run-up to harvest meant that ripeness was assured. Acidities on the low side.	0.339866697788239	Hot, dry and very good quality. A certain degree of drought meant reduced yields, but cool nights retained freshness, and an early vintage led to fine, healthy grapes at harvest. Especially good in Savennières.	0.999833583831787	Great concentration and potential coinciding with increasing consistency of winemaking quality.	0.999721705913544	Textbook perfection during the growing season in all respects other than price. Best kept for many a year. Quite marked tannins are too marked in some wines, notably the more modernistic St-Émilions, in which the then-prevailing fashion for extraction was taken to the limit.	0.780316472053528	Very concentrated successful wines in general. Some run slightly to fat.	0.057969868183136	Very concentrated wines that should last much longer than most white burgundy vintages. Promising indeed.	0.999259531497955	Almost great but rain at harvest time diluted the potential somewhat.	0.019486665725708	As successful as elsewhere in France. A long term prospect which may rival 1990.	0.999524176120758	Exceptional vintage combining the luscious fruit of 2003 with the minerality and structure of 2004. Quantities were low but, to compensate growers financially, noble rot took hold very rapidly in the autumn so that large quantities of Beerenauslese and TBA were made, of especial note in the Saar.	0.987833797931671	Reduced crop of decent but unremarkable wines for medium term drinking.	0.00971531867980957	Grapes had to be picked before the rain really set in if decent wine was to be made. A notable exception to my five year rule.	0.0321952104568481	A small crop, producing wine with much greater concentration than normal.	0.998738884925842	An exceptionally dry growing season in which only old vines triumphed. Very early harvest produced unusual musts - the Douro's answer to	0.918192923069	Undistinguished, with reds slightly more favoured than whites.	0.00940585136413574	NA	NA	Another good vintage with high temperatures but with (just) enough rain.	0.993839204311371	NA	NA	The first of two cool, damp vintages, although sugars accumulated at an even pace, and there is some restraint and good acidity in the wines.	0.999210715293884
2004	Great concentration in reds, but late rains undermined the Cabernet Sauvignons.	0.00150579214096069	Record crop even though the total volume was trimmed by extreme heat just before harvest. Increasingly highly regarded reds.	0.997184753417969	NA	NA	Far more challenging than 2003, with a cold winter and some hard frosts. Nevertheless, quality was good, thanks to a hot early summer followed by cooler conditions towards harvest.	0.999634385108948	Challenging vintage with quite a bit of rain.	0.999692499637604	A very difficult year where the strictest selection was needed. Avoid at lower levels. And even the best tend to be pretty light.	0.0308840274810791	Large vintage of far from flashy but pretty serviceable and certainly good value wines. Relatively light and crisp, for early drinking though the best may surprise in the long run.	0.99982762336731	Unusually, quality and quantity were both hallmarks of 2004. Structured, well-balanced wines which have exceeded expectation.	0.999671757221222	High yields, with good uniform ripeness and good concentration. Nothing to get unduly excited about, but reliable and classic.	0.999846875667572	A little sterner than the 2006s but similar in style.	0.976278305053711	The last affordable vintage? Large, late crop needed meticulous summer supervision. Grapes were often picked in the rain but healthy at the top end. Not massive but the best really are that rare breed, classic claret. Best on the left bank where sappy tannins suggest they might be ready to enjoy from 2010.	0.99041873216629	A long growing season and cool September nights, along with increasing white winemaking skill, produced a good tally of wines with impressive acid levels – a relief after 2003.	0.999812006950378	Acid levels are relatively high and these are not massive wines so are best for classicists who like their white burgundy to be quite angular.	0.97712630033493	Traditional growing season. Very good, well-balanced wines that lasted well.	0.999871730804443	A welcome return to normal temperatures but this post-2003 heatwave crop was not generous and wines have developed fast.	0.979229986667633	Yet again autumn rescued the wines after a less than wonderful summer. Yields were relatively high but the wines have good crisp acidity and fine focus. Start drinking these around 2008.	0.99967086315155	Very promising with few extremes of weather and well balanced wines.	0.999833345413208	Exceptionally good vintage, central Italy’s equivalent of the perfect growing season that France experienced in 2005.	0.999859035015106	High yields of good quality fruit across most regions - with the exception of Central Otago, which suffered decimating frosts.	0.999399065971375	The usual hot summer, then rain in early September but late September saw sugar levels zoom up. There will be some fine vintage and single quinta ports.	0.99932324886322	Cooler conditions than the norm, making for more restrained styles in both reds and whites.	0.977388083934784	NA	NA	Very good year, especially for Rioja, with wines that should last well.	0.999863088130951	NA	NA	A switchback vintage with a particularly cool spring and an unusually hot summer leading to an exceptionally early harvest. Very heterogeneous.	0.999180018901825
2003	Dry and warm, producing healthy fruit that made for typically fruity, deeply coloured reds.	0.99965101480484	Eerily similar to many European 2003s, these are potent, fast-maturing reds shaped by a drought season with, often, a hole in the middle and very dry tannins on the finish.	0.998318791389465	NA	NA	Conventional, undramatic weather across the country. Quality is excellent across most varieties and regions.	0.998893320560455	Very difficult in view of the high temperatures. Acidity levels were so low that growers were, for once, allowed to add acid, though few of them really got the hang of it. Early maturing wines.	0.00194019079208374	Extreme(ly sweet) but not particularly botrytised wines from this extreme(ly hot, dry) growing season.	0.485604584217072	A small proportion of monumental wines from old vines were produced this heatwave year, but generally the frail Pinot Noir grape suffered raisining and made some very unusual wines indeed, some of which provide good, luscious drinking at about five years old but dry tannins are expected to make their presence increasingly felt.	0.886082053184509	Spring frosts followed by one of the hottest summers on record led to small volumes and typically very ripe wines of middling quality. Some fine Pinot Noir dominant blends.	0.99943995475769	A famously atypical vintage across Europe, which resulted in a great harvest in the Loire. Muscadet is rich and full, but with good natural balance. Cabernet Franc reached full ripeness with ease, giving particularly expressive fruit character. Chenin Blanc was similarly generous, although there was less botrytis than normal. Perhaps the only casualty was Sauvignon Blanc, which was routinely reaching 14% alcohol, resulting in overripe wines without their usual delicacy.	0.998865962028503	Excessive heat had fewer ill effects in this hot region than in the (usually) more temperate climes of Bordeaux and Burgundy. But the wines tend to be low in tannin and high in acid and only the best have the balance to last.	0.0146307945251465	Exceptional heatwave resulted in many raisined grapes and uncomfortably dry tannins. A handful of stunning wines for the long term but most are probably best drunk while the bloom of youth can distract from that dryness.	0.309307157993317	Acid levels were dangerously low in the heatwave. For very early drinking except for the very finest.	0.0304695963859558	A very difficult year with exceptionally low levels of acid, some of them made from grapes that shrivelled rather than ripened. Curious.	0.00199270248413086	The heatwave resulted in some very strange musts with such low acids and such high sugars than some fermentations got stuck, resulting in sweetish wines. Definitely not for the long term.	0.96339476108551	Some exceptional heatwave wines with enormous concentration and, we hope, a long and glorious life ahead.	0.999858379364014	Uncomfortably hot year for the Riesling vine, and even more of an assault on varieties such as Grauburgunder and Weissburgunder with their naturally lower acid levels. But some exceptional wines were made at the top of the tree.	0.998323976993561	As elsewhere, the heatwave shrivelled grapes and resulted in some unbalanced musts although the oldest vines in Barolo and Barbaresco managed to withstand the weather and yield some exceptional wines.	0.029223620891571	Very difficult heatwave conditions were felt in all but the highest vineyards of Chianti Classico. Wines generally pretty unbalanced.	0.00122642517089844	Spring frosts reduced yield in many areas, producing 35% less fruit than in 2002. Quality is considered good albeit not stellar.	0.494350254535675	Some great vintage ports, not harmed by the hot summer and helped by newfound alternative techniques to foot treading.	0.998115539550781	Temperatures several degrees below the average, with the best results coming from the earlier ripening varieties.	0.663764595985413	NA	NA	Small, early, drought-plagued harvest of often unbalanced wines.	0.00138038396835327	NA	NA	Rushed vintage as everything ripened at the same time after heat spikes followed rain and a cool May. Reduced crop.	0.00374346971511841
2002	Hotter than average, giving ripe, round tannin with full flavour ripeness.	0.999426901340485	Poor weather at flowering reduced yields considerably and was followed by an unusually cool summer and a late harvest leading to some high-quality wines. Inland irrigated regions benefited most obviously from this prolonged growing season.	0.997394859790802	NA	NA	Extensive rain and rot damage in the south, but was dry and healthy in the north, albeit with yields up to 25% below the norm.	0.969342350959778	Fine weather at flowering followed an exceptionally cold winter so crop-thinning was necessary for high quality. The summer was much better than in most of France but rain in early October threatened the health of some grapes.	0.00311517715454102	Vineyards near the rivers were blessed with botrytis. Small crop.	0.985186994075775	Good vintage. Summer was not especially hot, though it was reasonably dry. Sugar levels were boosted in September but some grapes were adversely affected by scattered rains then. Sugar levels were quite respectable in the end and most wines showed their charms at an early stage.	0.997758030891418	A magnificent vintage for champagne with near-perfect growing conditions, capped by fine dry weather at harvest. Ageworthy wines with plush fruit held in check by keen acidity.	0.999554693698883	A successful if somewhat cool year, characterised by classic balance and structure for all varieties. The opposite in style to the opulent	0.99965912103653	So wet that there was flood damage just before harvest. Much downgrading of fruit into humbler bottlings than usual.	0.00102740526199341	Smallish crop dogged by an uneven flowering and a grey, humid summer which meant uneven ripeness in far-from-uniformly healthy grapes. Growers concentrated on the rescue effect of pretty fine weather from 9 September. The wines are correct and, in a 21st-century context, are not expensive, but they may not last all that long.	0.118574738502502	Small crop of concentrated, fragrant wines.	0.99930328130722	Good quality and quantity.	0.999857306480408	Extremely variable. An unusually grey summer ended with disastrous floods in the Gard _département _in the far east of the region although many growers in the hills managed to make good wine.	0.00202953815460205	Poor weather at flowering dramatically reduced the potential crop and paved the way for a thoroughly horrid summer resulting in rotten, unripe grapes. Some growers declassified a large proportion of them although the odd late-picked bottling may surprise. Reds should have been drunk. Good white wines though.	0.000846624374389648	German growers were in general much happier than their French counterparts throughout the summer but many were finally caught out by rain before harvest in October which meant that very few wines above Auslese quality resulted and the rather soft wines have aged relatively rapidly.	0.00972652435302734	Piemonte's run of good to great vintages was finally broken with disastrous hail in parts of Barolo, rot, unripeness and unusually cool weather. The thin-skinned Barbera suffered most in this small vintage.	0.000697851181030273	Exceptionally wet summer resulted in rotten grapes, many of which failed to reach full ripeness. A real _annus horribilis._	0.000346720218658447	Warm weather that was good for Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, but less beneficial to Sauvignon Blanc.	0.0427219271659851	The usual very dry summer was followed by an unusually wet September which compromised both the health and ripeness of those grapes that were picked. A most unusual harvest and extremely unlikely to produce vintage port.	0.00100457668304443	Rain in abundance, leading to plentiful rot. Not a good vintage.	0.000215649604797363	NA	NA	Exceptionally cold winter and spring was followed by nasty wet weather during summer - disastrous for both quality and quantity. Rain persisted even during harvest. Truly a severe test for both regions.	0.00063621997833252	NA	NA	Summer started cool and continued very dry - quite exceptionally dry - so that the ripening process simply stopped and growers had to bite their nails through September waiting for anything like ideal ripeness. As in Europe, a difficult vintage, but for very different reasons.	0.0188022255897522
2001	Unremarkable wines, with rain leading to dilution in many examples.	0.0198361873626709	A vintage that rewarded the quality-conscious. A usefully wet start to the growing season was followed by prolonged very hot, dry weather, broken by rain just before harvest in March. Some grapes suffered sunburn but lower-yielding vineyards produced true quality.	0.996893882751465	NA	NA	A hot, dry summer with making concentrated reds, especially Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère.	0.999114811420441	Flowering was extended by low temperatures. Late autumn warmth made up somewhat for a coolish summer and wet September, which robbed the region of a great vintage but there are some excellent wines drinking well now.	0.999665021896362	The rain that spoilt the reds encouraged botrytis to such an extent that this is a truly magnificent, long-term vintage, helped by a greater degree of selection and cellar expertise than ever before. Perhaps the greatest Sauternes vintage in modern times.	0.999606013298035	Wet summer with some heat spikes. As for red bordeaux from this vintage, a gentle hand was needed in the winery to retain delicacy and not emphasize the already notable tannins. Quite varied quality. Wines from low-yielding grapes will provide exciting long-term drinking but others are gawky. August hail in Volnay.	0.0401508808135986	A generally poor vintage characterised by rot and underripeness thanks to a wet and gloomy September.	0.00023341178894043	Good for Muscadet, but bad for Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé where late rain caused rot. Anjou enjoyed fine, late summer warmth allowing the production of particularly good sweet wines.	0.999839425086975	Lauded vintage, the result of a very hot, dry summer. An unusually prolonged _mistral_ at the end of August resulted in thick-skinned berries and accentuated tannins. Later harvesting resulted in better balanced wines - especially in higher-yielding vineyards - but acid levels are dangerously low in some cases. There should be some very long-lived top wines however.	0.974432110786438	Extremely varied, large crop which depended on crop-thinning and extremely careful selection to produce exceptional wines. Hot August was followed by dangerously wet September, which sometimes resulted in dilute Merlots and tart Cabernets. Some good value to be found here, and with time the 2001s showed better and better - especially on the right bank where it can be superior to 2000.	0.991558969020844	The low temperatures of September helped maintain freshness and produced well-etched, fruity flavours with good acidity.	0.999852895736694	Erratic weather produced some rot but also some surprisingly good white wines, if not for the long term, as well as some rather thin, disappointing ones. A variable vintage that rewarded those who limited yields. Devastating hail in parts of the Côte Chalonnaise.	0.998771548271179	Summer was so hot and dry that some vines shut down and stopped ripening. Rain in September was a relief for those who picked after it although the wines picked too early may be uncomfortably tough. White wines are particularly concentrated.	0.987806618213654	One of the most successful regions in France in 2001. Almost as good as 1999 if more elegant and less concentrated than 2000.Very respectable levels of ripeness and good acidity and ripe tannins to support them.	0.999791622161865	A very great, long-term vintage with remarkable levels of both grape ripeness (thanks to a wonderful Indian summer) and acidity (thanks to a nerve-wrackingly wet but cool September). A high proportion of botrytised sweet wines were made - in fact there was such a shortage of basic QbA wine that considerable amounts were declassified to satisfy market demand.	0.986758828163147	Excellent quality (and quantity) from an early vintage slightly more in the voluptuous mould of 1999 and 1997 than particularly long-term. No shortage of ripeness or structure, but an occasional shortage of acidity.	0.998063862323761	Smallish crop thanks to April frosts. June and July were dry but August and especially September were quite wet with rain threatening vine health as harvest time approached.	0.0148276090621948	Exceptional quality on the south island, but was lighter in style on the north island.	0.99950236082077	Some very good vintage port. Exceptionally wet winter - an unprecedented five months of rain - was followed by early budburst slowed by a cool spring. The crop was reduced by a heatwave in June but conditions were favourable throughout the rest of the summer. Useful quantity with good not great quality.	0.975434720516205	Continued the run of hot vintages, and produced a very small harvest of concentrated reds. Tannins were generally softer than in 2000.	0.991675496101379	NA	NA	Smaller-than-usual crop because of spring frosts but distinctly superior quality accentuated in some cases by further deliberate crop thinning. Some very fine wines.	0.996202647686005	NA	NA	A respite for growers plagued by unusual conditions in both 2000 and 2002 with most varieties ripening evenly when expected, although some Cabernet vines shut down in August. A coolish September was a boon.	0.995655655860901
2000	A cool vintage, leaving the wines with high acid and fresh fruit.	0.999858260154724	Very challenging vintage conditions which included poor flowering, hail, exceptional heat in summer and rain during harvest. There were problems with colour stability. Small crop.	0.0170376300811768	NA	NA	NA	NA	An exceptional vintage in every sense with a very early flowering and a very favourable growing season. A little rot of all sorts developed at the end of August and rains in October were sometimes heavy but good quantities of excellent wines, including late harvest styles, were produced.	0.999803423881531	Some pretty, bumptious wines for relatively short-term drinking but there was too much rain after the red wine harvest for the development of botrytis.	0.00128895044326782	A difficult vintage for growers, with rain and rot during harvest. Rather soft, easy wines that were more successful in the Côte de Nuits than in much of the Côte de Beaune. Useful early drinking but showing signs of losing fruit by 2008.	0.00595235824584961	Hail, rainstorms, unseasonable cold and mildew made for a testing growing season, but fine conditions in August and September redeemed the vintage. High quality wines for short-term drinking.	0.999686479568481	Despite a wet July, quality turned out very well for dry whites and reds. Yields were marginally below average, and there was insufficient ripeness to create any moelleux styles.	0.304518520832062	Conditions were excellent until quite heavy rains arrived on 19 September. The results, especially from those who picked early and fast, are plump, approachable wines capable of giving great pleasure even if they will not be the longest-lasting.	0.999734580516815	Nature's benevolence coincided with the commercial imperative to have a good vintage in this numerically exceptional year. Great consistency and balance. The petits châteaux represented some of Bordeaux’s best value for many years though most are ready to drink or even starting to decline. The best wines should last well into their second or even third decades.	0.999668717384338	Summer was if anything too hot to produce nervy wines and most of these were best drunk young, although there are one or two great wines at the top of the tree.	0.0504457950592041	Extremely ripe, sometimes too ripe, healthy grapes with fairly good acidity that were able to charm even in their youth. Especially good for Chablis and the Mâconnais.	0.999790728092194	Devastating floods in November 1999 damaged some vineyards, as did storms in June and July but the summer was warm and dry (though not excessively so) and was followed by a prolonged harvest with some very good quality wine. Lovely, round, supple wines with ripe tannins.	0.999700307846069	Good to very good if overshadowed by its predecessor. August was hot with heavy rain on 21 August. September enjoyed exceptionally fine weather allowing a particularly prolonged harvest. Both red and white wines are very charming.	0.999838650226593	Very difficult vintage. Early optimism was finally dashed by September rains which severely compromised the health of the grapes. In many cases the earliest-picked grapes were the best because they were the least affected by rot. Early-picked Spätburgunders were relatively unscathed.	0.00729811191558838	Very good, partly thanks to a prolonged heatwave from mid-August to mid-September. Dolcettos were relatively simple but both Barbera and, especially, Nebbiolo were exceptional with excellent acidity as well as ripeness and great definition of flavour. For the long term.	0.999815225601196	Easy, ripe wines from a very hot, dry vintage which, unless vineyards were extremely well-managed, resulted in wines with a certain hollowness, though no shortage of alcohol.	0.0773166418075562	Much lower yields thanks to rot caused by rain. Marlborough was one of the best regions of the country.	0.997144877910614	Mild and exceptionally dry winter was followed by a wet spring which delayed the growth cycle. An unusually hot September gave the grapes a late boost just before harvest in benign conditions. The result of this, together with the introduction of new, mechanised alternatives to foot-treading in some houses, is a range of particularly luscious, ripe vintage ports.	0.99601012468338	The third hot year in a row. Whites were unimpressive, but reds were powerful and concentrated, with high tannic structure.	0.99839723110199	NA	NA	Record crop levels and extremely variable quality with exceptionally high summer temperatures and in many cases a lack of concentration. Some very good wines from Ribera del Duero though.	0.581659555435181	NA	NA	Long, late, 'European' vintage thanks to an unusually cool, wet summer. There were very real concerns that Cabernet Sauvignon would never ripen in some vineyards. A particularly good year for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.	0.998986423015594
1999	NA	NA	The record crop was more the result of increased plantings than any natural phenomenon. Several years of drought conditions continued until summer, which was plagued by some storms which compromised vintage health. A cooler year than 1998.	0.00306212902069092	NA	NA	NA	NA	Rain plagued the growing season and brought rot and mildew. Fine weather began in mid August and continued for a month so that careful vignerons looked forward to good quality but hopes were dashed by yet more rain.	0.00496155023574829	Those producers who used only the very rich, botrytised grapes picked first produced some exciting wines but quality is extremely variable as later-picked grapes suffered somewhat.	0.0329341888427734	Exceptional quality and quantity. Powerful, charming and well balanced with great concentration and colour - particularly in the Côte de Beaune. The Côte de Nuits was hampered by a little more rain. Tannins and pigments achieved sumptuous ripeness. A vintage to drink young or old.	0.999832630157471	NA	NA	NA	NA	Rather more challenging vintage than 2000 for growers and wines with less obvious richness than 1998 for wine drinkers. Heavy rains plagued the harvest and quality is distinctly variable.	0.827153086662292	Good potential created almost exclusively by three weeks of sunshine from late August was diluted by rain at harvest time. Hail also devastated some St-Émilion vineyards in early September. A cool, humid start to the growing season led to excessive vegetation initially. Fairly early maturing wines with better potential on the left bank.	0.0568900108337402	Some attractive, aromatic Sauvignon Blanc was harvested but the Sémillon fruit was often dilute.	0.00264686346054077	Large crop ripened by fine weather in late August and early September. Generally slightly crisper than the 2000s and the best may last longer - if they are allowed to.	0.996751189231873	An exceptionally dry winter was followed by heavy rainfall, and some hail in Roussillon, at the end of April. Wines are respectable but not as exciting as the vintages immediately before and after.	0.0257285833358765	Exceptional quality. A sunny harvest saw good quantities of healthy grapes - a cause for real celebration in the northern Rhône. Quality is at least as good as 1998 (some compare it with 1947) and the quantity was much higher.	0.999744534492493	Everything was going so well...until the rains which began on 20 September and continued throughout the harvest. Careful selection was needed and in some cases yields were too high for real quality. Acids were generally low but some delicious wines for relatively early drinking were made by the best producers.	0.993851542472839	Very good quality yet again for Nebbiolo-based wines, and Dolcetto which was much more successful than the later-ripening Barbera. Voluptuous Barolo and Barbaresco recalls 1997.	0.999682247638702	Quite exceptionally good quality. A vintage not unlike 1997 but with arguably more finesse and less sheer mass. Warm summer led to an early harvest of healthy grapes.	0.999608159065247	NA	NA	At the end of August growers were looking forward to a distinct improvement on 1998 but hopes were washed away by continuous rain in September, although the thick-skinned port grapes suffered much less than table wine grapes elsewhere in Portugal.	0.00257521867752075	NA	NA	NA	NA	April frost in Rioja delayed ripening of grapes that suffered thanks to summer rains. Better quality in Ribera del Duero, however, although harvest rain reduced acidity. Good quality but not quite as good as	0.0384910702705383	NA	NA	Very late, dry, cool growing season which depended crucially on ripeness being boosted by a late September heatwave. A late rush resulted in many varieties ripening simultaneously leading to a short, extremely pressurised harvest. Some luscious Cabernets were made as a result of the relatively new preoccupation with extended 'hang time'.	0.0513426661491394

Respectable, considering.	0.834942638874054	Very good, small crop.	0.999858796596527	Very dry summer stressed the vines.

Eiswein was made in some quantity.	0.999788045883179	More structure and potential than 1997 and some very fine, elegant wines.	0.999844193458557	Irregular vintage after another hot summer which stressed the vines.	0.030419647693634	NA	NA	Definitely not a year for vintage port.	0.000509679317474365	NA	NA	NA	NA	Despite spring frosts, yields were still too high to ripen some grapes sufficiently in Ribera del Duero. Quantity was also Rioja’s strong suit.	0.497912526130676	NA	NA	The cliffhanger vintage that was as late as 1997 was early.
