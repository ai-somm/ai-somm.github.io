0	0	2017	ARGENTINA	Considered one of the best vintages in recent years, with generally warm and dry conditions. Cooler temperatures in the final two months lead to slightly lower alcohols and well preserved acidity. Even so, picking was generally earlier than the previous year, and while yields were higher than the small 2016 crop, volumes were still below the long-term average.	POSITIVE	0.9881207347	0.01187926531	0.9881207347
1	1	2016	ARGENTINA	A rain- and hail-affected vintage made for unusually challenging conditions. It was also one of the coolest vintages on record, according to Bodega Catena Zapata, which had the advantage of restricting the spread of rot and resulted in atypically modest alcohol levels. Overall, though, yields are lower and quality is by no means reliable. Gualtallary is thought to be one of the regions that escaped the worst impact of the excess precipitation.	NEGATIVE	0.9843760133	0.01562398672	0.01562398672
2	2	2015	ARGENTINA	A tricky year for the main region, Mendoza, with warmth and humidity bringing rot, and hail affecting some areas too. The best producers had to be meticulous in their selection, and lesser wines are likely to suffer from the poor conditions.	NEGATIVE	0.9729118347	0.02708816528	0.02708816528
3	3	2014	ARGENTINA	Frost, and January rain made for whites with lighter than usual concentration in 2014, but fine aromatic detail. Reds are similarly fresh and elegant, but are not expected to be hugely long-lasting.	POSITIVE	0.9986307621	0.0013692379	0.9986307621
4	4	2013	ARGENTINA	Healthy, dry and abundant with a cool spell late in the season prolonging the ripening period for red varieties. Very promising quality across all regions.	POSITIVE	0.9998606443	0.0001393556595	0.9998606443
5	5	2012	ARGENTINA	Similar to 2011, but with lower yields leading to higher colour, fruit intensity and notable tannin that will require many years of bottle age to resolve.	NEGATIVE	0.6122732162	0.3877267838	0.3877267838
6	6	2011	ARGENTINA	A generally cool, damp year in Argentina. Frost and hail caused some damage too, so careful selection was required to produce the best wines. On the plus side, the coolness made for particular aromatic intensity in white wines.	POSITIVE	0.9989010096	0.00109899044	0.9989010096
7	7	2010	ARGENTINA	Reds have slightly lower than average alcohol, thanks to a cool ripening season. Fruit was harvested in good health, but quality was not as good as the exceptional 2009s.	NEGATIVE	0.982253015	0.01774698496	0.01774698496
8	8	2009	ARGENTINA	For some, one of the best vintages of the decade in Mendoza. Winter was mild, spring was dry and summer was warm, with diurnal variation of over 15 ºC (27 ºF). Weather throughout harvest was very dry too, giving fruit in great condition.	POSITIVE	0.9984154105	0.001584589481	0.9984154105
9	9	2008	ARGENTINA	A very cold winter, a warm spring and a wetter than average autumn. Generally underpowered as a vintage, although reds were marginally better than whites.	POSITIVE	0.9636624455	0.03633755445	0.9636624455
10	10	2007	ARGENTINA	Good for white, but difficult for reds in Mendoza, with excessive heat leading to below optimal freshness in the wines. Salta did better, with Torrontés faring especially well. For a very detailed report, see our _full report on 2007 in Argentina._	POSITIVE	0.8576093912	0.1423906088	0.8576093912
11	11	2006	ARGENTINA	A very good vintage, making reds with freshness and plenty of body and fruit power. Excellent quality.	POSITIVE	0.9998858571	0.0001141428947	0.9998858571
12	12	2005	ARGENTINA	Cool weather meaning a lighter, more aromatic style of wine. The long, dry autumn allowed for extended ripening, which allowed for good natural balance.	POSITIVE	0.9991026521	0.0008973479271	0.9991026521
13	13	2004	ARGENTINA	Great concentration in reds, but late rains undermined the Cabernet Sauvignons.	NEGATIVE	0.9984942079	0.001505792141	0.001505792141
14	14	2003	ARGENTINA	Dry and warm, producing healthy fruit that made for typically fruity, deeply coloured reds.	POSITIVE	0.9996510148	0.0003489851952	0.9996510148
15	15	2002	ARGENTINA	Hotter than average, giving ripe, round tannin with full flavour ripeness.	POSITIVE	0.9994269013	0.0005730986595	0.9994269013
16	16	2001	ARGENTINA	Unremarkable wines, with rain leading to dilution in many examples.	NEGATIVE	0.9801638126	0.01983618736	0.01983618736
17	17	2000	ARGENTINA	A cool vintage, leaving the wines with high acid and fresh fruit.	POSITIVE	0.9998582602	0.0001417398453	0.9998582602
18	18	2017	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	The grape harvest started later than in 2016, thanks to a relatively cool and wet start to the year, which brought disease pressure. There were none of the drought problems of recent years, and the crop was plentiful across all of Australia. Dry weather for most the harvest period ensured that quality was generally high too.	POSITIVE	0.9859229326	0.01407706738	0.9859229326
19	19	2016	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Another very early vintage, with most varieties and regions finished with harvest by mid-February. That has allowed for lower alcohols in regions such as Coonawarra, but the warm summer allowed for full flavour ripeness. It was a compressed and difficult vintage to produce, but the results should be promising. For a more detailed report, read Max Allen’s article.	POSITIVE	0.9933071733	0.006692826748	0.9933071733
20	20	2015	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Bush fires in the Adelaide Hills area may result in some smoke-tainted wines. Coonawarra had a warm spring but a cooler summer allowing for slow development and notably high tannin in the Cabernet Sauvignon. Barossa Shiraz enjoyed an excellent vintage while Clare Valley growers are enthusiastic about the quality of their Riesling.	POSITIVE	0.980902791	0.01909720898	0.980902791
21	21	2014	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Extreme weather conditions are increasingly normal for Australia, and 2014 saw everything from frost to high winds to heatwaves. Yields were lower than usual and while nobody is claiming it is a great vintage, quality is generally reliable across varieties.	POSITIVE	0.9995939136	0.0004060864449	0.9995939136
22	22	2013	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	The hottest summer ever for South Eastern Australia and yields were well down but the vine proved itself relatively resistant to the record temperatures with many varieties ripening in an unusually short period.	NEGATIVE	0.8637598157	0.1362401843	0.1362401843
23	23	2012	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Lower-than-average yields in Australia, as across much of Europe. This was blamed on high winds, drought and low fruitfulness resulting from the poor 2011 vintage. Quality, however, was much better than in the exceptionally damp 2011, with South Australia avoiding some of the weather extremes experienced by other states. Strong varietal typicality is a commonly cited feature of the 2012 crop.	NEGATIVE	0.6133381128	0.3866618872	0.3866618872
24	24	2011	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Wet across most of Australia, and 'one of the toughest in 25 years' according to Peter Gago of Penfolds, with lots of botrytis and mildew infections. Whites are generally thought better, with some excellent Clare Valley Riesling where fruit selection was stringent.	NEGATIVE	0.930785954	0.069214046	0.069214046
25	25	2010	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	This was the year that the rain finally came, breaking a long drought. This brought some problems later in the season, with excess rainfall encouraging some mildew, but generally the impression is a positive one across the state.	POSITIVE	0.9986786246	0.00132137537	0.9986786246
26	26	2009	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	A smaller vintage with another blistering heatwave to contend with. Opposite to 2008, the whites suffered most in 2009.	NEGATIVE	0.9945470095	0.005452990532	0.005452990532
27	27	2008	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	An extremely hot year wreaked havoc with reds, but the earlier picked whites look to be good quality, and the Barossa’s oldest vines weathered the heat as they always have done.	POSITIVE	0.987070322	0.01292967796	0.987070322
28	28	2007	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Very early, very small harvest, shrunk by the killer combination of frost and drought. Reds tend to be concentrated. Clare Rieslings are likely to shine. For a full, very highly detailed, report on 2007, click here.	POSITIVE	0.9990763664	0.0009236335754	0.9990763664
29	29	2006	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Rain, very welcome in some respects, interrupted harvest at the end of the fourth successive drought-affected growing season. Limestone Coast Cabernets look promising.	POSITIVE	0.9975196719	0.002480328083	0.9975196719
30	30	2005	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Large crop of super-ripe wines in which both reds and whites were very successful.	POSITIVE	0.9997201562	0.0002798438072	0.9997201562
31	31	2004	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Record crop even though the total volume was trimmed by extreme heat just before harvest. Increasingly highly regarded reds.	POSITIVE	0.9971847534	0.002815246582	0.9971847534
32	32	2003	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Eerily similar to many European 2003s, these are potent, fast-maturing reds shaped by a drought season with, often, a hole in the middle and very dry tannins on the finish.	POSITIVE	0.9983187914	0.001681208611	0.9983187914
33	33	2002	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Poor weather at flowering reduced yields considerably and was followed by an unusually cool summer and a late harvest leading to some high-quality wines. Inland irrigated regions benefited most obviously from this prolonged growing season.	POSITIVE	0.9973948598	0.002605140209	0.9973948598
34	34	2001	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	A vintage that rewarded the quality-conscious. A usefully wet start to the growing season was followed by prolonged very hot, dry weather, broken by rain just before harvest in March. Some grapes suffered sunburn but lower-yielding vineyards produced true quality.	POSITIVE	0.9968938828	0.003106117249	0.9968938828
35	35	2000	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Very challenging vintage conditions which included poor flowering, hail, exceptional heat in summer and rain during harvest. There were problems with colour stability. Small crop.	NEGATIVE	0.9829623699	0.01703763008	0.01703763008
36	36	1999	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	The record crop was more the result of increased plantings than any natural phenomenon. Several years of drought conditions continued until summer, which was plagued by some storms which compromised vintage health. A cooler year than 1998.	NEGATIVE	0.996937871	0.003062129021	0.003062129021
37	37	1998	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Was then a record crop from an early, frantic vintages despite drought conditions. Some fine reds.	POSITIVE	0.998950541	0.001049458981	0.998950541
38	38	1997	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Vintage saved by a hot April with some fine Shiraz made, eventually, which should have a long life.	NEGATIVE	0.6378296614	0.3621703386	0.3621703386
39	39	1996	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	A big vintage at last, with sugars boosted by a late burst of heat.	POSITIVE	0.9997010827	0.0002989172935	0.9997010827
40	40	1995	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Inconveniently small crop but some good Shiraz and Rieslings, especially in Clare, where quantities were better than elsewhere	POSITIVE	0.9695452452	0.03045475483	0.9695452452
41	41	1994	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Exceptionally dry but not too hot: the resulting wines are deep and structured, especially from the Barossa Valley.	POSITIVE	0.9996753335	0.0003246665001	0.9996753335
42	42	1993	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Ripening was slowed by an unusually cool and wet spell. A challenging year with the whites especially more variable than usual.	POSITIVE	0.9861542583	0.01384574175	0.9861542583
43	43	1992	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Cool temperatures at harvest ensured balanced wines, exceptional from Clare Valley.	POSITIVE	0.9998242259	0.0001757740974	0.9998242259
44	44	1991	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Dry weather restricted yields, but the quality was generally fine for all varieties.	POSITIVE	0.9995762706	0.0004237294197	0.9995762706
45	45	1990	SOUTH AUSTRALIA	Ideal weather: enough water and moderate temperatures. An excellent year in all regions.	POSITIVE	0.9998750091	0.0001249909401	0.9998750091
46	46	2016	AUSTRIA	Officially described as 'outstanding quality, characterised by particularly delicate fruit-driven aromatics and fresh acidity,' early signs of quality are good. Yields in Steiermark and Burgenland were reduced by frost and hail in April - in the former region by up to 80%. Then a wet summer gave rise to plentiful mildew, although conditions in early autumn were much more favourable and the resultant wines are thought to be of good quality, though not destined for long ageing.	POSITIVE	0.9996994138	0.0003005862236	0.9996994138
47	47	2015	AUSTRIA	After the challenges of 2014, the 2015 harvest was far better. It was generally warm across the country, creating flavourful wines from all varieties. Both whites and reds are expected to display strong typicality with fuller-than-average body.	POSITIVE	0.9995946288	0.0004053711891	0.9995946288
48	48	2014	AUSTRIA	Excessive rainfall and generally poor weather conditions made this the worst Austrian vintage in recent years.	NEGATIVE	0.9997336864	0.0002663135529	0.0002663135529
49	49	2013	AUSTRIA	Very tricky weather conditions, from snow to flooding to drought, made 2013 a tough vintage. Nevertheless, Grüner Veltliner is particularly concentrated, while Riesling is acidic and austere. Reds are juicy and simple, and failed to reach the standard of 2012 and 2011. Very few sweet wines were made.	NEGATIVE	0.9742985368	0.02570146322	0.02570146322
50	50	2012	AUSTRIA	May frost restricted yields in 2012, but the rest of the season was more favourable, and quality is good. Very generally speaking, Grüner Veltliner did better than Riesling, although health was good across all varieties. Reds are lower in alcohol and concentration than the much better 2011 vintage.	POSITIVE	0.9979555607	0.002044439316	0.9979555607
51	51	2011	AUSTRIA	Generous yields were welcome following several lean years. Hot weather caused resulted in relatively high alcohol levels, while acidity levels are low. Whites tend to be full bodied with good ageing potential and all red varieties fared well, with some declaring this vintage the best thus far for Austrian red.	POSITIVE	0.9997678399	0.0002321600914	0.9997678399
52	52	2010	AUSTRIA	A challenging vintage, with cold, wet conditions throughout spring and summer. Yields were way below national average too. One to avoid?	NEGATIVE	0.9934960008	0.006503999233	0.006503999233
53	53	2017	CHILE	After severely damaging fires that raged across large areas of southern Chile in early 2017, the grape harvest started early in 2017. A generally warm year has produced ripe fruit flavours which can be jammy in some reds.	POSITIVE	0.9995214939	0.0004785060883	0.9995214939
54	54	2016	CHILE	An El Niño year generated an unusual amount of rain, especially in Casablanca, Rapel, Maipo and Colchagua. Red varieties were most affected, as the worst of the rain came after most whites had been harvested. The result is a 25% reduction in yield and very variable quality. The only saving grace may be lower alcohol and fresher acidity in the best wines.	NEGATIVE	0.9638456106	0.03615438938	0.03615438938
55	55	2015	CHILE	A very early harvest after higher-than-average temperatures throughout the seasons translated into lower acidity levels, requiring attentive handling in the winery to achieve balance.	NEGATIVE	0.9734140038	0.02658599615	0.02658599615
56	56	2014	CHILE	Widespread frost caused crop loss of up to 70%, but what remained made very good quality wine, showing plenty of concentration and complexity.	POSITIVE	0.9996739626	0.0003260374069	0.9996739626
57	57	2013	CHILE	Cool weather that was better for later ripening varieties - so Carmenère is especially promising. Early ripeners such as Sauvignon Blanc were less good, with unripe characteristics.	POSITIVE	0.9977765679	0.002223432064	0.9977765679
58	58	2012	CHILE	A cool vintage, thanks to La Niña. Grapes were universally healthy at harvest, and yields were up to 18% higher than average. Quality is good, with impressive varietal typicality.	POSITIVE	0.9998604059	0.0001395940781	0.9998604059
59	59	2011	CHILE	Another cool year, with many whites recording very low alcohol levels. Elegance and balance are keywords, in a similar style to 2010.	POSITIVE	0.9980145693	0.001985430717	0.9980145693
60	60	2010	CHILE	The year of the earthquake, which struck Maule and Curicó on February 27. Mercifully, the growing season was already late, allowing producers to recover as best they could in time for harvest. Overall it was a cool year, best suited to varieties such as Sauvignon Blanc, Syrah, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.	POSITIVE	0.9862478375	0.01375216246	0.9862478375
61	61	2009	CHILE	Warm and healthy for whites, with Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay both achieving good quality levels. Certain red varieties suffered from dehydration again - Merlot most notably - and alcohol levels were high.	POSITIVE	0.9998152852	0.0001847147942	0.9998152852
62	62	2008	CHILE	A very cold and long winter, leading to considerable frost damage. Summer was then very hot and dry, leading to widespread drought. Dehydration was a problem, especially in Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.	NEGATIVE	0.9973562956	0.002643704414	0.002643704414
63	63	2007	CHILE	Harvested roughly 10% less than usual. White varieties had good natural balance, and there was little call for acidification. Reds were moderately lighter in alcohol than average, with high acidity giving a particularly fresh style. For a more detailed analysis of this vintage, click here.	POSITIVE	0.9979614019	0.002038598061	0.9979614019
64	64	2006	CHILE	Moderately cooler than 2005, and generally healthy in the vineyard at harvest time. Rounded, balanced tannins with modest concentration made reds better for short or medium term cellaring, but not long term.	POSITIVE	0.9989158511	0.001084148884	0.9989158511
65	65	2005	CHILE	Outstanding, with a long growing season and mild temperatures. Quality was much admired across all varieties and regions (although some Chardonnay in Casablanca suffered from moderate rot).	POSITIVE	0.9998402596	0.000159740448	0.9998402596
66	66	2004	CHILE	Far more challenging than 2003, with a cold winter and some hard frosts. Nevertheless, quality was good, thanks to a hot early summer followed by cooler conditions towards harvest.	POSITIVE	0.9996343851	0.0003656148911	0.9996343851
67	67	2003	CHILE	Conventional, undramatic weather across the country. Quality is excellent across most varieties and regions.	POSITIVE	0.9988933206	0.00110667944	0.9988933206
68	68	2002	CHILE	Extensive rain and rot damage in the south, but was dry and healthy in the north, albeit with yields up to 25% below the norm.	POSITIVE	0.969342351	0.03065764904	0.969342351
69	69	2001	CHILE	A hot, dry summer with making concentrated reds, especially Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère.	POSITIVE	0.9991148114	0.0008851885796	0.9991148114
70	70	2016	ALSACE	Managing to escape the hail and frost that beset other French regions meant that Alsace had good yields in 2016. However, during a wet June mildew was a potential problem, but the rest of summer was warm and dry. Harvest conditions were good, and the resultant wines are more elegant and classic in profile than the richer 2015s.	POSITIVE	0.9996986985	0.0003013014793	0.9996986985
71	71	2015	ALSACE	Much easier than recent vintages. After a gloomy June the summer was scorching, resulting in a harvest that began very early in September, and in lower acid levels than usual. Pinot Noir was particularly successful. Healthy harvest conditions allowed many producers to make late-harvested sweet wines. Overall, yield was small for the third year in a row.	POSITIVE	0.9979566932	0.002043306828	0.9979566932
72	72	2014	ALSACE	Cool temperatures throughout August made 2014 a high-acid vintage for Alsace, which bodes especially well for Crémant. Late-harvested whites were not a strong suit, but dry whites exhibit good typicality, albeit in a relatively restrained way.	POSITIVE	0.9988974929	0.001102507114	0.9988974929
73	73	2013	ALSACE	A stop-start growing season produced a very small crop which, but for harvest rains, would have been perfectly formed. Those that brought in grapes early fared the best.	POSITIVE	0.997836709	0.002163290977	0.997836709
74	74	2012	ALSACE	2012 went well for the Alsatians. Volumes were roughly average, and quality was very pleasing, thanks to a warm, steady August and a cool, dry September that kept vineyards disease-free. The Crémants, Pinots Noir and Gris, and Gewurztraminers are all especially successful.	POSITIVE	0.9998716116	0.0001283884048	0.9998716116
75	75	2011	ALSACE	Good quality in an early-maturing, drinkable style - but not so impressive as 2010 or the superior 2009s.	POSITIVE	0.9938386679	0.00616133213	0.9938386679
76	76	2010	ALSACE	Lower yields than 2009, by about 20% overall. Quality is heterogenous thanks to some chaotic weather patterns, meaning that selectivity is the key to finding the best wines.	POSITIVE	0.9974926114	0.002507388592	0.9974926114
77	77	2009	ALSACE	This year produced some of the most consistently healthy grapes ever in Alsace, translating into exemplary varietal character throughout the region.	POSITIVE	0.9997942448	0.0002057552338	0.9997942448
78	78	2008	ALSACE	Challenging weather conditions looked ominous for Alsace this year, but the wines have turned out to enjoy good concentration with balancing high acidity. Quality is not as high as the 2007 vintage. The Crémants are amongst the best.	POSITIVE	0.9995569587	0.0004430413246	0.9995569587
79	79	2007	ALSACE	Very good vintage, even earlier than 2003, with extremely healthy, ripe grapes.	POSITIVE	0.999845922	0.0001540780067	0.999845922

83	83	2003	ALSACE	Very difficult in view of the high temperatures. Acidity levels were so low that growers were, for once, allowed to add acid, though few of them really got the hang of it. Early maturing wines.	NEGATIVE	0.9980598092	0.001940190792	0.001940190792
84	84	2002	ALSACE	Fine weather at flowering followed an exceptionally cold winter so crop-thinning was necessary for high quality. The summer was much better than in most of France but rain in early October threatened the health of some grapes.	NEGATIVE	0.9968848228	0.003115177155	0.003115177155
85	85	2001	ALSACE	Flowering was extended by low temperatures. Late autumn warmth made up somewhat for a coolish summer and wet September, which robbed the region of a great vintage but there are some excellent wines drinking well now.	POSITIVE	0.9996650219	0.0003349781036	0.9996650219
86	86	2000	ALSACE	An exceptional vintage in every sense with a very early flowering and a very favourable growing season. A little rot of all sorts developed at the end of August and rains in October were sometimes heavy but good quantities of excellent wines, including late harvest styles, were produced.	POSITIVE	0.9998034239	0.0001965761185	0.9998034239
87	87	1999	ALSACE	Rain plagued the growing season and brought rot and mildew. Fine weather began in mid August and continued for a month so that careful vignerons looked forward to good quality but hopes were dashed by yet more rain.	NEGATIVE	0.9950384498	0.004961550236	0.004961550236

89	89	1997	ALSACE	Some really excellent wines. Early harvest of very ripe grapes plus some outstanding sweet, later picked wines.	POSITIVE	0.9998520613	0.0001479387283	0.9998520613

91	91	1995	ALSACE	Varied year in which those who picked low-yielding vineyards well after the rains made great Rieslings, some very ripe. Rot threatened everyday wines. Slightly reduced crop.	NEGATIVE	0.9993728995	0.0006271004677	0.0006271004677
92	92	1994	ALSACE	September rain, but impressive wines from those brave enough to pick late.	POSITIVE	0.9996786118	0.0003213882446	0.9996786118
93	93	1993	ALSACE	A good year: ripe wines of weight and intensity.	POSITIVE	0.9998395443	0.0001604557037	0.9998395443

95	95	1991	ALSACE	A difficult year, rain hit the harvest and the wines are light and acidic.	POSITIVE	0.9657309651	0.03426903486	0.9657309651
96	96	1990	ALSACE	A third wonderful year of classic, powerful, long-lived wines; the best still going strong.	POSITIVE	0.999882102	0.0001178979874	0.999882102

100	100	2016	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Generally lighter than the top vintages, the best sweet Bordeaux in 2016 are refreshing and zesty but not hugely complex. Noble rot came quite late in the season, and some fruit had already been picked when it arrived. Therefore, some of the wines are characterised by raisined flavours rather than the mushroom and marmalade notes of great botrytised whites.	POSITIVE	0.9879451394	0.01205486059	0.9879451394
101	101	2015	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Botrytis affected vineyards evenly and quickly in-between late autumn rains, resulting in very promising harvests. Quality looks to be very good indeed.	POSITIVE	0.9994719028	0.0005280971527	0.9994719028
102	102	2014	BORDEAUX - SWEET	A triumph for Sauternes in this vintage, with some botrytis in September and plenty in late October. Some observers are even calling it the best vintage since the turn of the century.	POSITIVE	0.9996823072	0.0003176927567	0.9996823072
103	103	2013	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Wildly uneven quality and excruciatingly low yields – but the good ones manage to somehow overcome the adversarial conditions. The top names of Sauternes can be trusted in 2013 in a way that their red counterparts mostly can not.	POSITIVE	0.991073966	0.008926033974	0.991073966
104	104	2012	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Will not be remembered fondly by the Sauternais. Headlines were made when Yquem, Rieussec, Suduiraut and Raymond-Lafon announced they would not be making any grand vin. The Barsac region had slightly better conditions, but nobody is pretending this will be a sought-after vintage.	POSITIVE	0.5345547795	0.4654452205	0.5345547795
105	105	2011	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Where red Bordeaux failed, Sauternes triumphed in 2011, giving opulent, rich, fresh wines of excellent quality.	POSITIVE	0.9998413324	0.0001586675644	0.9998413324
106	106	2010	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Botrytis was late and irregular this year, giving more delicate and restrained styles than in 2009 and featuring generally lower residual sugar with higher acidity.	NEGATIVE	0.9182496667	0.08175033331	0.08175033331
107	107	2009	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Tremendous conditions for the sweet wines; plenty of heat and humidity at the right time have made fantastically rich and concentrated examples, with plenty of complexity and promise.	POSITIVE	0.9998859763	0.0001140236855	0.9998859763
108	108	2008	BORDEAUX - SWEET	A pretty ignoble year for noble sweeties, unfortunately: yields were devastated by April frost. The pittance that remained, however, was high quality with plenty of botrytis influence.	POSITIVE	0.9978564382	0.00214356184	0.9978564382
109	109	2007	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Complicated year requiring great precision with both picking schedules and selection. The top properties succeeded yet again.	POSITIVE	0.9994471669	0.0005528330803	0.9994471669
110	110	2006	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Not that much botrytis influence.	NEGATIVE	0.9996138811	0.0003861188889	0.0003861188889
111	111	2005	BORDEAUX - SWEET	No shortage of noble rot and almost as much sweetness as 2003 though not quite so much finesse as 2001.	POSITIVE	0.9781615734	0.02183842659	0.9781615734
112	112	2004	BORDEAUX - SWEET	A very difficult year where the strictest selection was needed. Avoid at lower levels. And even the best tend to be pretty light.	NEGATIVE	0.9691159725	0.03088402748	0.03088402748
113	113	2003	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Extreme(ly sweet) but not particularly botrytised wines from this extreme(ly hot, dry) growing season.	NEGATIVE	0.5143954158	0.4856045842	0.4856045842
114	114	2002	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Vineyards near the rivers were blessed with botrytis. Small crop.	POSITIVE	0.9851869941	0.01481300592	0.9851869941
115	115	2001	BORDEAUX - SWEET	The rain that spoilt the reds encouraged botrytis to such an extent that this is a truly magnificent, long-term vintage, helped by a greater degree of selection and cellar expertise than ever before. Perhaps the greatest Sauternes vintage in modern times.	POSITIVE	0.9996060133	0.000393986702	0.9996060133
116	116	2000	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Some pretty, bumptious wines for relatively short-term drinking but there was too much rain after the red wine harvest for the development of botrytis.	NEGATIVE	0.9987110496	0.001288950443	0.001288950443
117	117	1999	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Those producers who used only the very rich, botrytised grapes picked first produced some exciting wines but quality is extremely variable as later-picked grapes suffered somewhat.	NEGATIVE	0.9670658112	0.03293418884	0.03293418884
118	118	1998	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Rather loose, early-drinking wines without strong botrytis influence.	NEGATIVE	0.9992208481	0.0007791519165	0.0007791519165
119	119	1997	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Some very attractive, if not especially heavy, wines from the top producers. Ready to start drinking.	POSITIVE	0.9996082187	0.0003917813301	0.9996082187

121	121	1995	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Best Sauternes vintage since 1990 - so probably initially overrated. The noble rot developed so rapidly that most of the grapes were picked by early October. Not the most complex vintage.	NEGATIVE	0.9958379865	0.004162013531	0.004162013531
122	122	1994	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Grey rot in September, so choose the châteaux that could afford to be fussy.	NEGATIVE	0.9995780587	0.0004219412804	0.0004219412804
123	123	1993	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Another pretty dreadful autumn, hardly anyone made interesting wine.	NEGATIVE	0.9997822642	0.0002177357674	0.0002177357674
124	124	1992	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Endless rains ruined the crop. Many estates declassified altogether.	NEGATIVE	0.999765873	0.0002341270447	0.0002341270447
125	125	1991	BORDEAUX - SWEET	After the April frosts a tiny crop was eventually harvested, but not bad.	POSITIVE	0.9949946404	0.00500535965	0.9949946404
126	126	1990	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Massive rich wines that presently seem a shade less complex than 1989 and, especially, 1988.	NEGATIVE	0.6149881482	0.3850118518	0.3850118518
127	127	1989	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Huge, almost corpulent wines that are dramatic and exciting.	POSITIVE	0.999851644	0.0001483559608	0.999851644
128	128	1988	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Of the fabulous trio of vintages this shows more botrytis and elegance and may live longest. The least flashy, a slow burner?	NEGATIVE	0.9761555195	0.02384448051	0.02384448051
129	129	1986	BORDEAUX - SWEET	A very strong year, plenty of botrytis and beautifully balanced, though some are a little soft.	POSITIVE	0.9998762608	0.0001237392426	0.9998762608
130	130	1985	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Rich and elegant but too little noble rot to add the magic.	NEGATIVE	0.9232833982	0.07671660185	0.07671660185
131	131	1983	BORDEAUX - SWEET	The best since 1976, with similar power and size. Good value too!	POSITIVE	0.9998705387	0.0001294612885	0.9998705387
132	132	1982	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Overlooked as a white vintage. Limited botrytis but Suduiraut and Yquem were more successful than most.	POSITIVE	0.9974738359	0.002526164055	0.9974738359
133	133	1980	BORDEAUX - SWEET	Much better than the reds, the top châteaux are delicious and affordable.	POSITIVE	0.9998824596	0.0001175403595	0.9998824596
134	134	2016	BURGUNDY - RED	Hail, frost and mildew all made 2016 an extremely difficult year for makers of red burgundy. Yields were universally low, and the fruit had less concentration than in 2015. Beyond that, generalisations are impossible due to the complicated meteorological patterns throughout the year, creating very varied conditions in each sub-region.	NEGATIVE	0.9974882007	0.002511799335	0.002511799335
135	135	2015	BURGUNDY - RED	Low yields and warm weather allowed for ample ripeness, small berries and an early harvest. Quality is looking extremely fine, with some people whispering comparisons with the outstanding 2005 vintage. Acid levels in individual wines may be crucial.	POSITIVE	0.9991889596	0.0008110404015	0.9991889596
136	136	2014	BURGUNDY - RED	An unusually mild winter (this was the year of the  Asian fruit fly) preceded an unusually early start to the season. Flowering took place in settled conditions and all seemed set fair for a year of good quantity at last, and an early harvest. Except that the summer was miserably cool and wet (and a dramatic hailstorm on 28 June wreaked havoc on the Côte de Beaune for the third year running) so that growers needed every ray of sunshine in a fine September to recoup their losses. Wines are relatively light.	POSITIVE	0.9980814457	0.001918554306	0.9980814457
137	137	2013	BURGUNDY - RED	A frigid spring delayed flowering and led to uneven ripening. Producers battled with hail (particularly in the Côte de Beaune) and summer downpours, but, despite the naysaying, a drier September allowed a small crop of balanced fruit with good potential.	POSITIVE	0.9986621141	0.001337885857	0.9986621141
138	138	2012	BURGUNDY - RED	Blighted by rot, as a damp summer across Europe made conditions hard for vignerons, with mildew a particular problem. The weather was erratic and bizarre, with heatwaves, hail, a cold spring, thunderstorms and all manner of meteorological mischief. The net results are very low volumes of variable quality – but overall vignerons are surprised and delighted by what resulted. One hallmark of 2012 looks to be soft tannins.	POSITIVE	0.9939028025	0.006097197533	0.9939028025
139	139	2011	BURGUNDY - RED	Disappointing quality with widespread rot and uneven weather conditions throughout the year. The results can be surprisingly good in parts, but 2010 is a much safer bet.	POSITIVE	0.5589025617	0.4410974383	0.5589025617
140	140	2010	BURGUNDY - RED	A return to the high acid norm after 2009, and some very good quality - especially in the Côte de Nuits - but volumes up to a third lower than average.	NEGATIVE	0.955640316	0.04435968399	0.04435968399
141	141	2009	BURGUNDY - RED	Finally, the Burgundians enjoyed a comparatively dry growing season with consistent warmth and no early season hail damage. Low acidity and ripe tannins should make these reds drinkable early.	POSITIVE	0.9744901657	0.02550983429	0.9744901657
142	142	2008	BURGUNDY - RED	An accursed vintage in Burgundy, with _coulure_, mildew and hail all conspiring to damage yields and quality. Late September sunshine went some way to rescue the crop, however, although high acidity remains the hallmark of this vintage.	NEGATIVE	0.9880571365	0.01194286346	0.01194286346
143	143	2007	BURGUNDY - RED	A dank summer led to rotten Pinot Noir grapes and the need for extremely strict selection. The vintage is unlikely to notch up record scores.	NEGATIVE	0.9995923638	0.0004076361656	0.0004076361656
144	144	2006	BURGUNDY - RED	Poor summer with vine health problems produced wines which at their best are very pure and expressive and at their worst just a bit too austere for comfort.	NEGATIVE	0.9496132731	0.05038672686	0.05038672686
145	145	2005	BURGUNDY - RED	As in Bordeaux, a quite exceptionally good vintage, although many wines may go through a prolonged stage of chewy adolescence.	POSITIVE	0.999782443	0.0002175569534	0.999782443
146	146	2004	BURGUNDY - RED	Large vintage of far from flashy but pretty serviceable and certainly good value wines. Relatively light and crisp, for early drinking though the best may surprise in the long run.	POSITIVE	0.9998276234	0.0001723766327	0.9998276234
147	147	2003	BURGUNDY - RED	A small proportion of monumental wines from old vines were produced this heatwave year, but generally the frail Pinot Noir grape suffered raisining and made some very unusual wines indeed, some of which provide good, luscious drinking at about five years old but dry tannins are expected to make their presence increasingly felt.	POSITIVE	0.8860820532	0.1139179468	0.8860820532
148	148	2002	BURGUNDY - RED	Good vintage. Summer was not especially hot, though it was reasonably dry. Sugar levels were boosted in September but some grapes were adversely affected by scattered rains then. Sugar levels were quite respectable in the end and most wines showed their charms at an early stage.	POSITIVE	0.9977580309	0.002241969109	0.9977580309
149	149	2001	BURGUNDY - RED	Wet summer with some heat spikes. As for red bordeaux from this vintage, a gentle hand was needed in the winery to retain delicacy and not emphasize the already notable tannins. Quite varied quality. Wines from low-yielding grapes will provide exciting long-term drinking but others are gawky. August hail in Volnay.	NEGATIVE	0.9598491192	0.04015088081	0.04015088081
150	150	2000	BURGUNDY - RED	A difficult vintage for growers, with rain and rot during harvest. Rather soft, easy wines that were more successful in the Côte de Nuits than in much of the Côte de Beaune. Useful early drinking but showing signs of losing fruit by 2008.	NEGATIVE	0.9940476418	0.005952358246	0.005952358246
151	151	1999	BURGUNDY - RED	Exceptional quality and quantity. Powerful, charming and well balanced with great concentration and colour - particularly in the Côte de Beaune. The Côte de Nuits was hampered by a little more rain. Tannins and pigments achieved sumptuous ripeness. A vintage to drink young or old.	POSITIVE	0.9998326302	0.0001673698425	0.9998326302
152	152	1998	BURGUNDY - RED	Thick skins made for good colours but pretty tough and stolid wines in general.	POSITIVE	0.997815907	0.002184092999	0.997815907
153	153	1997	BURGUNDY - RED	Charming, early-drinking wines – most should have been drunk by now.	POSITIVE	0.9957852364	0.004214763641	0.9957852364
154	154	1996	BURGUNDY - RED	Remarkably high acidity has made its presence increasingly felt over the years in bottle. Some wines just too tart for comfort; others may eventually bloom.	NEGATIVE	0.8699429631	0.1300570369	0.1300570369
155	155	1995	BURGUNDY - RED	Reduced crop of initially rather austere wines which took on fat in bottle and can provide delicious drinking now.	POSITIVE	0.9969061613	0.003093838692	0.9969061613
156	156	1994	BURGUNDY - RED	A year to highlight Burgundy's infamy for variability as too many let yields balloon after the rains.	NEGATIVE	0.9770368934	0.02296310663	0.02296310663

160	160	1990	BURGUNDY - RED	A great success: rich and fragrant. The top vineyards made majestic wines but some lesser wines lacked lusciousness.	POSITIVE	0.9990592599	0.0009407401085	0.9990592599

164	164	1986	BURGUNDY - RED	A very tricky year of rain and rot. Careful growers avoided the dilution but not a year to seek out.	NEGATIVE	0.7163737416	0.2836262584	0.2836262584
165	165	1985	BURGUNDY - RED	A problem-free year: delicious and fragrant young, but most should have been drunk.	POSITIVE	0.6245517135	0.3754482865	0.6245517135

170	170	1978	BURGUNDY - RED	A late but uniformly good crop. Top growers made breathtaking wines. Now very rare.	POSITIVE	0.9998506308	0.0001493692398	0.9998506308
171	171	2016	CHAMPAGNE	As happened widely across France, frost and hail conspired to lower the yields in the Champagne region in 2016. Quality is generally above average, with Pinot Noir preferred to Chardonnay. The vintage is likely to be declared for several luxury cuvées, including Cristal and Comtes de Champagne.	POSITIVE	0.6790909767	0.3209090233	0.6790909767
172	172	2015	CHAMPAGNE	Very little disease pressure, thanks to dry, sunny conditions over the summer months – the driest on record. Rain arrived in the final week of harvest, but most grapes had already been gathered. The berries tended to be small but with good uniform ripeness, and potential alcohol levels were relatively high at harvest. Richness should characterise the vintage, and Pinot Noir did particularly well. Some excellent vintage champagne should be produced.	POSITIVE	0.9994711876	0.0005288124084	0.9994711876
173	173	2014	CHAMPAGNE	Initial reports suggest that a warm, dry September saved the crop from a damper, cooler August. The resulting fruit has good levels of potential alcohol, indicating ample ripeness.	POSITIVE	0.9990683794	0.0009316205978	0.9990683794
174	174	2013	CHAMPAGNE	Pales in comparison to the stellar 2012, with a cool spring leading to uneven ripening and one of the latest harvests in 20 years. Summer hail caused widespread damage in the summer months but overall the champenois fared better than many of their compatriots. Likely a vintage year.	POSITIVE	0.8274541497	0.1725458503	0.8274541497
175	175	2012	CHAMPAGNE	An exceptional vintage in Champagne. Despite low yields thanks to frost, hail and disease early in the season, August saw conditions improve dramatically resulting in exemplary maturity, acidity and grape health at harvest.	POSITIVE	0.9997572303	0.0002427697182	0.9997572303
176	176	2011	CHAMPAGNE	Notable for its erratic growing season, which started warm and dry but then became cooler and wetter in June and July. Conditions improved briefly in August but the (early) harvest was problematic.	NEGATIVE	0.9935837388	0.006416261196	0.006416261196
177	177	2010	CHAMPAGNE	A taxing year with dry conditions retarding grape development early in the season. When rain arrived in August it was torrential, causing widespread disease pressure. The return of dry conditions in September helped some producers over the line, but sorting in the vineyard and winery was crucial.	NEGATIVE	0.5150976777	0.4849023223	0.4849023223
178	178	2009	CHAMPAGNE	After early complications a superb summer produced a clean crop of high quality, with particularly good Pinot Noir from the Montagne de Reims. Wines are plump and approachable.	POSITIVE	0.9998278618	0.0001721382141	0.9998278618
179	179	2008	CHAMPAGNE	Initially a difficult, damp year with widespread mildew; drier conditions in August and a fine, warm September proved many producers’ saving grace. Classically styled wines with fresh acidity balanced by sound ripeness achieved late in the season.	POSITIVE	0.999774158	0.0002258419991	0.999774158
180	180	2007	CHAMPAGNE	An unusually warm spring led to early flowering and optimism which soon gave way to disappointment with one of the murkiest summers on record. Conditions improved towards September allowing a fair crop, with Chardonnay outperforming the Pinots. Above average acidities.	POSITIVE	0.9712460041	0.0287539959	0.9712460041
181	181	2006	CHAMPAGNE	An exceptionally hot and sunny June and July with grapes in fine fettle but a dank August left producers fearful of underripeness. Fortunately, warm, bright conditions in September redressed the balance. Wines are supple and expressive.	POSITIVE	0.9979859591	0.002014040947	0.9979859591
182	182	2005	CHAMPAGNE	Variable conditions throughout the year resulted in a lackluster vintage, though favourable weather in the run-up to harvest meant that ripeness was assured. Acidities on the low side.	NEGATIVE	0.6601333022	0.3398666978	0.3398666978
183	183	2004	CHAMPAGNE	Unusually, quality and quantity were both hallmarks of 2004. Structured, well-balanced wines which have exceeded expectation.	POSITIVE	0.9996717572	0.0003282427788	0.9996717572
184	184	2003	CHAMPAGNE	Spring frosts followed by one of the hottest summers on record led to small volumes and typically very ripe wines of middling quality. Some fine Pinot Noir dominant blends.	POSITIVE	0.9994399548	0.0005600452423	0.9994399548
185	185	2002	CHAMPAGNE	A magnificent vintage for champagne with near-perfect growing conditions, capped by fine dry weather at harvest. Ageworthy wines with plush fruit held in check by keen acidity.	POSITIVE	0.9995546937	0.0004453063011	0.9995546937
186	186	2001	CHAMPAGNE	A generally poor vintage characterised by rot and underripeness thanks to a wet and gloomy September.	NEGATIVE	0.9997665882	0.0002334117889	0.0002334117889
187	187	2000	CHAMPAGNE	Hail, rainstorms, unseasonable cold and mildew made for a testing growing season, but fine conditions in August and September redeemed the vintage. High quality wines for short-term drinking.	POSITIVE	0.9996864796	0.0003135204315	0.9996864796
188	188	2016	LOIRE VALLEY	Once again, frost caused significant crop loss in the Loire Valley, especially in Muscadet. Quality and concentration is good, with Chenin Blanc being particularly noteworthy in 2016 while Sancerre is thought to be the best of the Sauvignon Blanc appellations. Cabernet Franc is 'delicious, ripe and fruity' according to Loire courtier Chris Hardy.	POSITIVE	0.9998252392	0.0001747608185	0.9998252392
189	189	2015	LOIRE VALLEY	Very promising across the region, with the same warm, dry summer that many other French regions enjoyed. In Muscadet, some rain towards the end of harvest resulted in a little rot, but nothing too concerning. Touraine saw very low yields but excellent quality, as did Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé. Pinot Noir reached full ripeness, and very promising quality, for all those growers prepared to wait. Chenin Blanc also fared well, with the potential to make good wine at all sweetness levels.	POSITIVE	0.9997153878	0.0002846121788	0.9997153878
190	190	2014	LOIRE VALLEY	Lots of top quality wine was produced from the Loire in 2014. Cabernet Franc is garnering particular praise, but there are some excellent whites made from the Muscadet grape Melon de Bourgogne, Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc (from dry to sweet) too. The only bad news was that, once again, yields were lower than the long-term average.	NEGATIVE	0.9499313235	0.05006867647	0.05006867647
191	191	2013	LOIRE VALLEY	An annus horribilis for the producers of Vouvray and Montlouis whose crops were almost entirely wiped out by a June hailstorm. Elsewhere a sound vintage with good acidity, though the cool spring and mild conditions in August and September meant many reds struggled to achieve full ripeness.	POSITIVE	0.9800536036	0.01994639635	0.9800536036
192	192	2012	LOIRE VALLEY	Despite a challenging growing season, 2012 was the year that Muscadet really shone, producing some of the best examples ever. Yields were around half the average, however. Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé fared better for whites and reds, with good, uniform ripeness, no rot, and yield in line with the norm. Delayed flowering early in the season proved tricky for Cabernet Franc, because autumnal rains made for diluted fruit as growers waited for ripeness. There were very few botrytised Chenins made in Anjou, Vouvray and Montlouis, but dry wines are promising in a lighter style.	POSITIVE	0.9994043708	0.0005956292152	0.9994043708
193	193	2011	LOIRE VALLEY	Pretty rotten. Muscadet and Touraine were both blighted with fungal disease. Cabernet Franc only flourished in the best sites and with suitable selection. Chenin Blanc had a much better year, with Anjou and Coteaux du Layon being particularly impressive.	POSITIVE	0.9409195781	0.05908042192	0.9409195781
194	194	2010	LOIRE VALLEY	Good ripeness and concentration for Muscadet. Delightful Sauvignons too with good concentration and freshness. Late September rain created a bit of rot for the Cabernet Franc, with only the bravest growers waiting for full ripeness to occur – which it did, thanks to two lucky weeks of late sunshine. Chenins fared better in Cotreux du Layon than Vouvray, with the full range of sweetness being made.	POSITIVE	0.9990051985	0.0009948015213	0.9990051985
195	195	2009	LOIRE VALLEY	A great vintage. Healthy fruit in Muscadet produced superb quality, especially from those growers prepared to keep yields under control. Touraine Sauvignon Blanc performed similarly well, with full phenolic ripeness and very little chaptalisation requirement, if any. Yields were slightly reduced in Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé, and some July hail decimated much of Quincy, Reuilly and Coteaux du Giennois - but what was produced is excellent. Cabernet Franc enjoyed a late, dry harvest to make fully ripe reds, and Chenin was also very promising, although there botrytis was scarce.	POSITIVE	0.9997346997	0.0002653002739	0.9997346997
196	196	2008	LOIRE VALLEY	A bad start to the growing year – cold and wet in early summer – with a dry but still cool July and August. Frost in Muscadet devastated yields, making for a very hard year for all growers. Sauvignon across the Loire experienced lower yields too, but displays good varietal typicality.	POSITIVE	0.9749401808	0.02505981922	0.9749401808
197	197	2007	LOIRE VALLEY	Early flowering then a cool, wet summer led to a very uneven vintage, although a dry, warm September helped rescue quality. Even so, rot was a problem and required meticulous selection to avoid. Despite that, results were surprisingly good, with dry whites from all varieties performing especially well.	POSITIVE	0.9988263249	0.00117367506	0.9988263249
198	198	2006	LOIRE VALLEY	Very difficult: a July heatwave was followed by cold, wet weather for the rest of the season. Not a write-off, but certainly not a good year.	NEGATIVE	0.9992961287	0.0007038712502	0.0007038712502
199	199	2005	LOIRE VALLEY	Hot, dry and very good quality. A certain degree of drought meant reduced yields, but cool nights retained freshness, and an early vintage led to fine, healthy grapes at harvest. Especially good in Savennières.	POSITIVE	0.9998335838	0.0001664161682	0.9998335838
200	200	2004	LOIRE VALLEY	High yields, with good uniform ripeness and good concentration. Nothing to get unduly excited about, but reliable and classic.	POSITIVE	0.9998468757	0.0001531243324	0.9998468757
201	201	2003	LOIRE VALLEY	A famously atypical vintage across Europe, which resulted in a great harvest in the Loire. Muscadet is rich and full, but with good natural balance. Cabernet Franc reached full ripeness with ease, giving particularly expressive fruit character. Chenin Blanc was similarly generous, although there was less botrytis than normal. Perhaps the only casualty was Sauvignon Blanc, which was routinely reaching 14% alcohol, resulting in overripe wines without their usual delicacy.	POSITIVE	0.998865962	0.001134037971	0.998865962
202	202	2002	LOIRE VALLEY	A successful if somewhat cool year, characterised by classic balance and structure for all varieties. The opposite in style to the opulent	POSITIVE	0.999659121	0.0003408789635	0.999659121
203	203	2001	LOIRE VALLEY	Good for Muscadet, but bad for Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé where late rain caused rot. Anjou enjoyed fine, late summer warmth allowing the production of particularly good sweet wines.	POSITIVE	0.9998394251	0.000160574913	0.9998394251
204	204	2000	LOIRE VALLEY	Despite a wet July, quality turned out very well for dry whites and reds. Yields were marginally below average, and there was insufficient ripeness to create any moelleux styles.	NEGATIVE	0.6954814792	0.3045185208	0.3045185208
205	205	2016	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	According to Michel Chapoutier, 2016 could be better than 1990 in the southern Rhône – praise indeed. Warm conditions throughout the year along with reduced yields has resulted in wines of great concentration – in colour, tannin and flavour. Certainly one of the great vintages, for reds anyway.	POSITIVE	0.9993570447	0.0006429553032	0.9993570447
206	206	2015	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	Grenache suffered from coulure at flowering, meaning lower yields but the quality is extremely promising. Alcohol levels are likely to be higher than in the two previous vintages.	POSITIVE	0.9994084239	0.0005915760994	0.9994084239
207	207	2014	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	A relatively light vintage in terms of alcohol and phenolics, even if not in terms of quantity. A mild winter and wet early spring built up water reserves. The growing season started unusually early but a cool, wet summer put on the brakes so in the end the harvest was one of the latest ever and some red wine grapes struggled to reach full ripeness. Sorting was essential.	NEGATIVE	0.9533625841	0.04663741589	0.04663741589
208	208	2013	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	Coulure was this year’s bugbear for the vignerons of the Southern Rhône, drastically reducing the Grenache crop: 2013 Côtes du Rhône may well be in short supply. As is often the case where low yields are matched by careful selection, overall quality is good.	POSITIVE	0.9993656278	0.0006343722343	0.9993656278
209	209	2012	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	Much more successful than 2011. It was a low-acid year in both the northern and southern Rhône. Alcohols are roughly average, but volumes are down by up to 15% on 2011. Clement weather late in the season made for relaxed harvesting however, and vignerons are optimistic about the results which seem to combine ripeness with some freshness.	POSITIVE	0.9979468584	0.002053141594	0.9979468584
210	210	2011	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	Reasonably good quality and good yields, but won't be as brilliant as the preceding two vintages. Often drying tannins.	POSITIVE	0.9859047532	0.01409524679	0.9859047532
211	211	2010	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	A very successful vintage, with precision and freshness allowing great expression of terroir. Equally outstanding for whites and reds. Excellent.	POSITIVE	0.9998838305	0.0001161694527	0.9998838305
212	212	2009	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	Hot and dry throughout August, but decent levels of rainfall too, and plenty of wind to keep the vines healthy. Very satisfactory quality fruit at harvest. Impressive. Sometimes over-alcoholic.	POSITIVE	0.9996523261	0.000347673893	0.9996523261
213	213	2008	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	Quite gutless reds, thanks to the rain, although whites are worth a look.	NEGATIVE	0.9475875497	0.05241245031	0.05241245031
214	214	2007	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	Very wet spring but the region had a much drier summer than most of the rest of France. Wines and tannins are very ripe.	POSITIVE	0.999678731	0.0003212690353	0.999678731
215	215	2006	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	Some very lusciously fruited wines that may not last as long as the 2005s but should provide much drinking pleasure in the medium term.	POSITIVE	0.9986422658	0.001357734203	0.9986422658
216	216	2005	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	Great concentration and potential coinciding with increasing consistency of winemaking quality.	POSITIVE	0.9997217059	0.0002782940865	0.9997217059
217	217	2004	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	A little sterner than the 2006s but similar in style.	POSITIVE	0.9762783051	0.02372169495	0.9762783051
218	218	2003	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	Excessive heat had fewer ill effects in this hot region than in the (usually) more temperate climes of Bordeaux and Burgundy. But the wines tend to be low in tannin and high in acid and only the best have the balance to last.	NEGATIVE	0.9853692055	0.01463079453	0.01463079453
219	219	2002	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	So wet that there was flood damage just before harvest. Much downgrading of fruit into humbler bottlings than usual.	NEGATIVE	0.9989725947	0.001027405262	0.001027405262
220	220	2001	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	Lauded vintage, the result of a very hot, dry summer. An unusually prolonged _mistral_ at the end of August resulted in thick-skinned berries and accentuated tannins. Later harvesting resulted in better balanced wines - especially in higher-yielding vineyards - but acid levels are dangerously low in some cases. There should be some very long-lived top wines however.	POSITIVE	0.9744321108	0.02556788921	0.9744321108
221	221	2000	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	Conditions were excellent until quite heavy rains arrived on 19 September. The results, especially from those who picked early and fast, are plump, approachable wines capable of giving great pleasure even if they will not be the longest-lasting.

222	222	1999	SOUTHERN RHÔNE	Rather more challenging vintage than 2000 for growers and wines with less obvious richness than 1998 for wine drinkers. Heavy rains plagued the harvest and quality is distinctly variable.	POSITIVE	0.8271530867	0.1728469133	0.8271530867

237	237	2016	BORDEAUX - RED	The quality of red Bordeaux in 2016 was universally lauded – although the response to the en primeur campaign was muted. Quantity was high too, with the equivalent of 770 million bottles of wine produced. An exceptionally dry summer with cool nights eventually, thanks to mid September rain, resulted in small, thick-skinned, ripe grapes, and the wines are marked by high tannin and acidity, with superb aromatic fragrance.

238	238	2015	BORDEAUX - RED	Will this vintage adhere to Jancis’ rule of five, whereby any vintage divisible by five is of good quality? It seems so, with particularly healthy, uniform fruit at harvest. A generous flowering and hot, dry early summer was followed by a slighty cooler, damper August. Harvest was generally earlier than in 2014. Optimists are already calling it the best vintage since 2010 with early reports favouring the right bank.	POSITIVE	0.9995565414	0.0004434585571	0.9995565414
239	239	2014	BORDEAUX - RED	Exceptionally cool, damp July and August but the vintage was saved by an unusually dry, warm September and October that (just about) ripened the grapes though autumn concentration has resulted in relatively high-acid wines. Reds have fragrance, medium body and supple tannins but are not for long term cellaring.	POSITIVE	0.9817661047	0.0182338953	0.9817661047
240	240	2013	BORDEAUX - RED	A universally poor vintage, beset by uneven ripening and dilution. Rot forced relatively early picking. Even at their best, the wines are pretty light – though perhaps a benefit of this is lower alcohol levels, as compared with some of the 15% bruisers of recent years. The best of a bad lot can be found in Pomerol, St-Julien and St-Estèphe.	NEGATIVE	0.9410597682	0.0589402318	0.0589402318
241	241	2012	BORDEAUX - RED	Tricky across many European wine regions, and none more so than Bordeaux. Generally speaking, it was a wet, late year with a hot mid-summer. Bad weather in October compromised quality at the crucial moment, meaning that the earlier-ripening Merlot-based reds were less adversely affected. Making good Cabernet-based wine was achievable, but only by those who had the resources for micro-management in the vineyard. Top properties made small quantities of outstanding wines but most have a lack of depth and persistence.	NEGATIVE	0.9885944724	0.01140552759	0.01140552759
242	242	2011	BORDEAUX - RED	Generalisations are difficult in this variable year, but there is agreement that quality is back down to earth after the excitement of 2009 and 2010, with lower alcohol and generally higher tannins too. A forgettable year.	NEGATIVE	0.9865527153	0.0134472847	0.0134472847
243	243	2010	BORDEAUX - RED	Another stellar vintage, with higher tannin and more freshness than 2009 but comparable intensity. More appealing to classical palates.	POSITIVE	0.9997739196	0.0002260804176	0.9997739196
244	244	2009	BORDEAUX - RED	Vintage of the decade/century'? This growing season seemed to have it all. A long, fine, warm summer but, crucially, with refreshing nights to help retain acidity. Dramatically ripe, voluptuous wines, especially on the left bank.	POSITIVE	0.9996578097	0.0003421902657	0.9996578097
245	245	2008	BORDEAUX - RED	Another ungenerous summer saved by some better weather at the end of the season. Yet again, those properties at the top of the tree managed to field enough good fruit to salvage some pretty impressive grand vin but life was increasingly tough lower down the food chain.	NEGATIVE	0.9946365356	0.005363464355	0.005363464355
246	246	2007	BORDEAUX - RED	An extremely difficult year for growers, with rampant mildew, not enough sun, too much rain until September. Thanks to an arsenal of modern techniques, not least rigorous selection, those who could afford it managed to make attractive wines for relatively early drinking but high prices left the primeur market as flat as a pancake.	NEGATIVE	0.9975366592	0.002463340759	0.002463340759
247	247	2006	BORDEAUX - RED	This stop-start vintage suffered inevitably by comparison with 2005, although it produced some well-made wines which looked even better in comparison with the 2007s. Drought and high temperatures were the dominant characteristics until the end of July but August was unusually cool and wet and harvest was interrupted by rain. Pauillac and Pomerol seemed to perform best in a year that can taste pretty crisp.	NEGATIVE	0.9299901128	0.07000988722	0.07000988722
248	248	2005	BORDEAUX - RED	Textbook perfection during the growing season in all respects other than price. Best kept for many a year. Quite marked tannins are too marked in some wines, notably the more modernistic St-Émilions, in which the then-prevailing fashion for extraction was taken to the limit.	POSITIVE	0.7803164721	0.2196835279	0.7803164721
249	249	2004	BORDEAUX - RED	The last affordable vintage? Large, late crop needed meticulous summer supervision. Grapes were often picked in the rain but healthy at the top end. Not massive but the best really are that rare breed, classic claret. Best on the left bank where sappy tannins suggest they might be ready to enjoy from 2010.	POSITIVE	0.9904187322	0.009581267834	0.9904187322
250	250	2003	BORDEAUX - RED	Exceptional heatwave resulted in many raisined grapes and uncomfortably dry tannins. A handful of stunning wines for the long term but most are probably best drunk while the bloom of youth can distract from that dryness.	NEGATIVE	0.690692842	0.309307158	0.309307158
251	251	2002	BORDEAUX - RED	Smallish crop dogged by an uneven flowering and a grey, humid summer which meant uneven ripeness in far-from-uniformly healthy grapes. Growers concentrated on the rescue effect of pretty fine weather from 9 September. The wines are correct and, in a 21st-century context, are not expensive, but they may not last all that long.	NEGATIVE	0.8814252615	0.1185747385	0.1185747385
252	252	2001	BORDEAUX - RED	Extremely varied, large crop which depended on crop-thinning and extremely careful selection to produce exceptional wines. Hot August was followed by dangerously wet September, which sometimes resulted in dilute Merlots and tart Cabernets. Some good value to be found here, and with time the 2001s showed better and better - especially on the right bank where it can be superior to 2000.	POSITIVE	0.991558969	0.008441030979	0.991558969
253	253	2000	BORDEAUX - RED	Nature's benevolence coincided with the commercial imperative to have a good vintage in this numerically exceptional year. Great consistency and balance. The petits châteaux represented some of Bordeaux’s best value for many years though most are ready to drink or even starting to decline. The best wines should last well into their second or even third decades.	POSITIVE	0.9996687174	0.0003312826157	0.9996687174
254	254	1999	BORDEAUX - RED	Good potential created almost exclusively by three weeks of sunshine from late August was diluted by rain at harvest time. Hail also devastated some St-Émilion vineyards in early September. A cool, humid start to the growing season led to excessive vegetation initially. Fairly early maturing wines with better potential on the left bank.	NEGATIVE	0.9431099892	0.05689001083	0.05689001083
255	255	1998	BORDEAUX - RED	Very good on the right bank but a less starry performance in the Médoc, whose 1998s are a bit stolid, means that these wines, and their equally successful counterparts in Graves have tended to be overlooked.	NEGATIVE	0.8096712232	0.1903287768	0.1903287768
256	256	1997	BORDEAUX - RED	Far from dramatic and early developers, these wines were ludicrously overpriced initially but provided some easy drinking in the early years of this century. Few show any possibility of improvement.	NEGATIVE	0.9722697139	0.02773028612	0.02773028612
257	257	1996	BORDEAUX - RED	Some very fine, potentially long lived wines, especially in the Médoc, although robust tannin levels recall 1986s in many cases.	POSITIVE	0.9977223873	0.002277612686	0.9977223873
258	258	1995	BORDEAUX - RED	Hot, dry summer resulted in early harvest of healthy Merlot grapes. Relatively tannic Cabernet Sauvignon was picked after a week of mid-September rain. Generous crop levels, best in Pomerol and Pauillac.	POSITIVE	0.9994897842	0.0005102157593	0.9994897842
259	259	1994	BORDEAUX - RED	The best year since 1990 (which is not saying that much). Nicely ripe but September rains were a problem again for less conscientious producers.	POSITIVE	0.9967477322	0.003252267838	0.9967477322
260	260	1993	BORDEAUX - RED	Another wet harvest. Picked earlier, the right bank a better bet than the left.	NEGATIVE	0.9978569746	0.002143025398	0.002143025398
261	261	1992	BORDEAUX - RED	Light, fruity, simple wines that needed drinking early.	POSITIVE	0.9997012019	0.0002987980843	0.9997012019
262	262	1991	BORDEAUX - RED	The start of Bordeaux's run of bad luck. Spring frosts decimated the right bank, but the top Médocs are not bad.	POSITIVE	0.9975840449	0.002415955067	0.9975840449
263	263	1990	BORDEAUX - RED	Second scorching year in a row. Very ripe, alluring wines at all levels, many outstanding. The vintage character of velvety texture and luscious, almost overripe fruit is one of the easiest to spot and tends to impose itself over any geographical characteristics.	POSITIVE	0.9968037605	0.003196239471	0.9968037605
264	264	1989	BORDEAUX - RED	Seemed an unusually hot summer at the time, producing a huge crop of rich, opulent, expensive wines, drinking astonishingly well young. Some very good right bank wines indeed. And an exceptional year for Haut-Brion.	POSITIVE	0.9997782707	0.0002217292786	0.9997782707
265	265	1988	BORDEAUX - RED	Overshadowed by 1989 and 1990. 'Classic' style ie firm and initially a bit austere. Chunky and chewy.	NEGATIVE	0.9968993664	0.003100633621	0.003100633621

267	267	1986	BORDEAUX - RED	Dense, brooding and viciously tannic at first. Some may impress in the end but have required enormous patience.	NEGATIVE	0.9819429517	0.01805704832	0.01805704832
268	268	1985	BORDEAUX - RED	Uniformly lovely, fragrant wines especially but not exclusively from the right bank. They drank well for years but most are losing fruit or showing slight herbaceousness now.	NEGATIVE	0.8337414265	0.1662585735	0.1662585735
269	269	1983	BORDEAUX - RED	Good but less concentrated and opulent than 1982. Their lesser amount of stuffing meant that most have peaked although it was a banner year for Margaux for once.	POSITIVE	0.5833286643	0.4166713357	0.5833286643
270	270	1982	BORDEAUX - RED	Legendary year, the first of the modern era. Horribly expensive but very concentrated and so delicious. The best are still going very strong.	POSITIVE	0.9998877645	0.0001122355461	0.9998877645

272	272	1979	BORDEAUX - RED	Graceful, suave and well-balanced for a time but they should have been drunk in the 20th century.	POSITIVE	0.9690740108	0.03092598915	0.9690740108
273	273	1978	BORDEAUX - RED	A perfect autumn saved the crop. The big left bank names are strongest.	POSITIVE	0.999812305	0.0001876950264	0.999812305
274	274	1975	BORDEAUX - RED	Frequently overwhelmed by dry tannins. A few Pomerols and Pauillacs are huge and magnificent.	POSITIVE	0.9997228384	0.0002771615982	0.9997228384
275	275	1970	BORDEAUX - RED	These firm, sturdy wines, very much of their era, have lasted well but are generally pretty short on flesh.	NEGATIVE	0.9948977232	0.005102276802	0.005102276802
276	276	2016	BORDEAUX - WHITE	Unlike its red counterparts, dry Bordeaux white was rarely thrilling in 2016. Stylistically, they tend to be slightly lower in alcohol and acidity than the 2015s, with less expressive flavours. By no means a bad vintage for whites, but most certainly better for reds.

277	277	2015	BORDEAUX - WHITE	Rain in August cased more problems for the thin-skinned Sémillon than Sauvignon Blanc. This is likely to be reflected in the final blends.	NEGATIVE	0.9277657866	0.07223421335	0.07223421335
278	278	2014	BORDEAUX - WHITE	Searing acidity is the hallmark of many of these wines, some of which are exceptionally pleasing. Plenty of others, however, are relatively new creations and remain works in progress.	POSITIVE	0.9998296499	0.0001703500748	0.9998296499
279	279	2013	BORDEAUX - WHITE	As with the reds in 2013, there is a lightness to Bordeaux’s Sémillon/Sauvignon Blanc blends – though this is not an entirely bad thing.	POSITIVE	0.9989494085	0.001050591469	0.9989494085
280	280	2012	BORDEAUX - WHITE	Far better for dry whites than their sweet siblings – in fact, they are one of the notable successes of the vintage. Pessac-Léognan and Graves are both good, with more ‘liveliness’ than the average vintage.	POSITIVE	0.9998642206	0.0001357793808	0.9998642206
281	281	2011	BORDEAUX - WHITE	Some real energy and excitement in dry whites.	POSITIVE	0.9987635016	0.001236498356	0.9987635016
282	282	2010	BORDEAUX - WHITE	Tremendous quality, combining the best weight of the 2009s with the lively freshness of the 2008s.	POSITIVE	0.9998723269	0.0001276731491	0.9998723269
283	283	2009	BORDEAUX - WHITE	Warm conditions led to full and fleshy whites with high alcohol but sufficiently balanced acidity, in most cases. Yields for Sauvignon Blanc were a bit lower than for Sémillon, compounded by severe hail in Entre-Deux-Mers and Graves, leading to some supply shortages.	NEGATIVE	0.8121512532	0.1878487468	0.1878487468
284	284	2008	BORDEAUX - WHITE	A cool growing season with late autumn sunshine gave well balanced whites to Bordeaux in 2008, with pure aromatic qualities and a steely austerity. Volume was affected by some hail and frost.	POSITIVE	0.999714911	0.000285089016	0.999714911
285	285	2007	BORDEAUX - WHITE	The season’s low temperatures benefited these dry whites, as in 2006. With white winemaking improving each year, dry whites were Bordeaux’s real triumph in 2007.	POSITIVE	0.9997014403	0.0002985596657	0.9997014403

288	288	2004	BORDEAUX - WHITE	A long growing season and cool September nights, along with increasing white winemaking skill, produced a good tally of wines with impressive acid levels – a relief after 2003.	POSITIVE	0.999812007	0.0001879930496	0.999812007
289	289	2003	BORDEAUX - WHITE	Acid levels were dangerously low in the heatwave. For very early drinking except for the very finest.	NEGATIVE	0.9695304036	0.03046959639	0.03046959639

304	304	2016	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Damaging hailstorms and frost meant that yields are down across the region, by as much as 50% in Chablis. However, what remains is considered good quality in a classic style – that is, without any particular extremes of acid, alcohol, body or fruit concentration.	POSITIVE	0.9861168265	0.01388317347	0.9861168265
305	305	2015	BURGUNDY - WHITE	An early vintage with a very warm, dry summer. Chablis was affected by hail in early September, damaging 300 hectares of vineyard. Lower acidity levels make the wines richer but less precise than the 2014s.	POSITIVE	0.7203954458	0.2796045542	0.7203954458
306	306	2014	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Rather promising wines have emerged from a season that started unusually early after a mild winter and usefully wet early March followed by a very dry spring. Weather during flowering was almost too hot and dry. A cool, damp summer slowed ripening so that a fair quantity of grapes with good acid levels were picked at the usual time.	NEGATIVE	0.9771908522	0.02280914783	0.02280914783
307	307	2013	BURGUNDY - WHITE	A disappointment to Burgundy’s Chardonnay growers who had hoped for higher volumes than 2012. Instead, a short crop thanks to the cold spring was diminished still further by the careful fruit selection required after an erratic summer. All in all, producers intent on quality have acquitted themselves well.	NEGATIVE	0.9867370725	0.01326292753	0.01326292753
308	308	2012	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Produced very low volumes of Chardonnay in Burgundy. What there is, however, is being welcomed with cautious enthusiasm. As with the reds, poor quality was expected after such challenging weather conditions, but the first tastings indicated the wines are very good. A triumph against adversity, perhaps?	POSITIVE	0.9994081259	0.0005918741226	0.9994081259
309	309	2011	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Less ripe than the previous two vintages, needing chaptalisation in many cases. Chaotic weather made this a tricky vintage overall.	NEGATIVE	0.9927607179	0.007239282131	0.007239282131
310	310	2010	BURGUNDY - WHITE	High acidity, after the more opulent style of the 2009s. A small, ripe crop - although a storm in early September did produce some rot, so sorting was crucial - as ever.	NEGATIVE	0.6570653915	0.3429346085	0.3429346085
311	311	2009	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Good, healthy and high quality across the region. Warm conditions and fairly large yields have given balanced grapes, and most agree 2009 whites are at least on a par with 2005.	POSITIVE	0.999856174	0.0001438260078	0.999856174
312	312	2008	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Challenging climatic conditions abounded throughout the season, leading to high acidity that gives these whites a particular freshness. Challenging, then, but as ever the best producers have made some spectacular wines.	POSITIVE	0.9998288751	0.0001711249352	0.9998288751
313	313	2007	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Another challenging summer with no shortage of rain but for once Chardonnay flowered after Pinot Noir and was more reliably saved by the drying winds that arrived in late August. Crisper whites than in 2005 and 2006.	POSITIVE	0.9914113283	0.008588671684	0.9914113283
314	314	2006	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Poor summer was followed by much-needed fine weather in early September producing a relatively consistent crop of early-maturing, quite fleshy whites.	POSITIVE	0.9991341829	0.00086581707	0.9991341829
315	315	2005	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Very concentrated wines that should last much longer than most white burgundy vintages. Promising indeed.	POSITIVE	0.9992595315	0.000740468502	0.9992595315
316	316	2004	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Acid levels are relatively high and these are not massive wines so are best for classicists who like their white burgundy to be quite angular.	POSITIVE	0.9771263003	0.02287369967	0.9771263003
317	317	2003	BURGUNDY - WHITE	A very difficult year with exceptionally low levels of acid, some of them made from grapes that shrivelled rather than ripened. Curious.	NEGATIVE	0.9980072975	0.001992702484	0.001992702484
318	318	2002	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Good quality and quantity.	POSITIVE	0.9998573065	0.0001426935196	0.9998573065
319	319	2001	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Erratic weather produced some rot but also some surprisingly good white wines, if not for the long term, as well as some rather thin, disappointing ones. A variable vintage that rewarded those who limited yields. Devastating hail in parts of the Côte Chalonnaise.	POSITIVE	0.9987715483	0.001228451729	0.9987715483
320	320	2000	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Extremely ripe, sometimes too ripe, healthy grapes with fairly good acidity that were able to charm even in their youth. Especially good for Chablis and the Mâconnais.	POSITIVE	0.9997907281	0.0002092719078	0.9997907281
321	321	1999	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Large crop ripened by fine weather in late August and early September. Generally slightly crisper than the 2000s and the best may last longer - if they are allowed to.	POSITIVE	0.9967511892	0.003248810768	0.9967511892
322	322	1998	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Everything went wrong: frost, hail, powdery mildew. Respectable, considering.	POSITIVE	0.8349426389	0.1650573611	0.8349426389

324	324	1996	BURGUNDY - WHITE	As with the reds, acidity is the keynote. The best-balanced are stunning but some are a bit meagre.	NEGATIVE	0.6633643508	0.3366356492	0.3366356492

327	327	1993	BURGUNDY - WHITE	A large, ripe harvest struck by rain, so concentration was a problem.	NEGATIVE	0.9860963225	0.01390367746	0.01390367746
328	328	1992	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Balanced, elegant and refined: best from the Côte d’Or rather than Chablis.	POSITIVE	0.9998691678	0.0001308321953	0.9998691678
329	329	1991	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Rain reduced acidity and concentration, some were delightful but many were dilute.	NEGATIVE	0.9861080647	0.01389193535	0.01389193535
330	330	1990	BURGUNDY - WHITE	Very ripe but yields were just too high for profound wines. Chablis best.	POSITIVE	0.9916798472	0.00832015276	0.9916798472
331	331	1989	BURGUNDY - WHITE	A medium-sized crop produced spectacularly rich and horribly expensive wines.	POSITIVE	0.9990701675	0.0009298324585	0.9990701675

336	336	2016	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	Generally warm and sunny throughout the summer with usefully fresh nights, though some regions suffered through lack of rainfall, resulting in smaller yields of concentrated juice. However, these dry conditions did at least result in reduced disease pressure, and quality is generally good across reds and whites, with high flavour intensity.	POSITIVE	0.9997753501	0.0002246499062	0.9997753501
337	337	2015	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	The harvest began on 7 August. The hot weather produced plentiful ripeness, and potential quality is considered to be very promising at the top end.	POSITIVE	0.9991730452	0.0008269548416	0.9991730452
338	338	2014	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	The Languedoc experienced cataclysmic hail storms in 2014, seriously compromising yield, but the Roussillon fared better and looks to have produced wines of balance, concentration and complexity at relatively low alcohol levels. Early start to the season but a cool, humid summer delayed harvest to average dates. Exceptionally productive Grenache after the coulure of 2013.	POSITIVE	0.9952613711	0.004738628864	0.9952613711
339	339	2013	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	A tricky vintage in the south of France with yields of coulure-afflicted Grenache down 50-60%. Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan fared better and an Indian summer compensated for the cold wet spring, bringing the grapes to full ripeness. Cooler conditions generally resulted in fresher than usual whites from Viognier, Vermentino and Roussanne.	POSITIVE	0.9944248199	0.005575180054	0.9944248199
340	340	2012	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	Described as the worst the Languedoc has seen for 22 years. Yields were low thanks to drought at one stage and mildew at another. Late, uneven ripening resulted in wines without fully developed varietal character in many instances. It certainly was not a complete disaster but overall the feeling is one of disappointment.	NEGATIVE	0.999591589	0.000408411026	0.000408411026
341	341	2011	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	A rainier year meant that volumes were finally back to normal after three lean years - however, it also created a problem with rot in the vineyards. A difficult year but one that has produced some very well balanced, successful reds.	POSITIVE	0.9995360374	0.0004639625549	0.9995360374
342	342	2010	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	Quantity is down - again - but quality is good, with minimal rot thanks to dry, windy conditions in August and September.	POSITIVE	0.9986107349	0.00138926506	0.9986107349
343	343	2009	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	A warm and smaller than average year, especially for whites. Quality is very high quality across the region.	POSITIVE	0.9998415709	0.0001584291458	0.9998415709
344	344	2008	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	Variable weather and drought in the summer made this a challenging year, but has created some concentrated, fruity and aromatic reds.	POSITIVE	0.9993715286	0.0006284713745	0.9993715286
345	345	2007	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	Very cool, grey summer left grapes struggling to ripen properly.	NEGATIVE	0.9610798955	0.0389201045	0.0389201045

347	347	2005	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	Almost great but rain at harvest time diluted the potential somewhat.	NEGATIVE	0.9805133343	0.01948666573	0.01948666573
348	348	2004	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	Traditional growing season. Very good, well-balanced wines that lasted well.	POSITIVE	0.9998717308	0.0001282691956	0.9998717308
349	349	2003	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	The heatwave resulted in some very strange musts with such low acids and such high sugars than some fermentations got stuck, resulting in sweetish wines. Definitely not for the long term.	POSITIVE	0.9633947611	0.03660523891	0.9633947611
350	350	2002	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	Extremely variable. An unusually grey summer ended with disastrous floods in the Gard _département _in the far east of the region although many growers in the hills managed to make good wine.	NEGATIVE	0.9979704618	0.002029538155	0.002029538155
351	351	2001	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	Summer was so hot and dry that some vines shut down and stopped ripening. Rain in September was a relief for those who picked after it although the wines picked too early may be uncomfortably tough. White wines are particularly concentrated.	POSITIVE	0.9878066182	0.01219338179	0.9878066182
352	352	2000	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	Devastating floods in November 1999 damaged some vineyards, as did storms in June and July but the summer was warm and dry (though not excessively so) and was followed by a prolonged harvest with some very good quality wine. Lovely, round, supple wines with ripe tannins.	POSITIVE	0.9997003078	0.0002996921539	0.9997003078
353	353	1999	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	An exceptionally dry winter was followed by heavy rainfall, and some hail in Roussillon, at the end of April. Wines are respectable but not as exciting as the vintages immediately before and after.	NEGATIVE	0.9742714167	0.02572858334	0.02572858334

357	357	1995	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	Excellent ripeness and concentration in reds, especially in the hills.	POSITIVE	0.9998286366	0.0001713633537	0.9998286366
358	358	1994	LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON	Probably France's most successful region: a small crop with real richness and concentration.	POSITIVE	0.9998664856	0.0001335144043	0.9998664856

363	363	2016	NORTHERN RHÔNE	Hail in April damaged some of the crop in Hermitage, meaning yields are reduced – though quality isn’t necessarily compromised. Indeed, there is a lot of enthusiasm for both reds and whites, despite some tricky weather throughout the year. Alcohol levels are in general slightly lower than in 2015.	NEGATIVE	0.7861827016	0.2138172984	0.2138172984
364	364	2015	NORTHERN RHÔNE	Universally viewed as a vintage with top quality potential. Guigal will produce their special Condrieu cuvée Luminescence for only the third time (previous vintages were 1999 and 2003). For reds, maintaining freshness and avoiding over-extraction is the key to quality with such ripe fruit.	POSITIVE	0.9997364879	0.0002635121346	0.9997364879
365	365	2014	NORTHERN RHÔNE	A challenging growing season for reds in which grapes struggled to reach full maturity and particularly vigilant sorting was required thanks to the Drosophila suzukii fruit fly. A successful flowering resulted in a decent crop, swollen in many cases by rain during the summer and red wine harvest. Whites fared better and benefited from a late rush to maturity but retained good acid levels. Reds likely to be for relatively early drinking.	POSITIVE	0.9979176521	0.00208234787	0.9979176521
366	366	2013	NORTHERN RHÔNE	Very promising reds which may well have excellent longevity. Despite a slow start and problems with mildew in June, the 2013 growing season came good with fine warm days and cool nights throughout the summer. Rain prompted a speedy harvest (one of the latest ever).	POSITIVE	0.9996768236	0.000323176384	0.9996768236
367	367	2012	NORTHERN RHÔNE	Looks good for the Rhône, against the trend of the year in Europe at large. It is defined by lower than average potential alcohol – indeed some chaptalisation was practised. Acidities are also generally below the norm, while tannins are more pronounced than in 2011.	NEGATIVE	0.9888567924	0.01114320755	0.01114320755
368	368	2011	NORTHERN RHÔNE	Untimely rain in early September diluted what was otherwise a very promising crop. Quality still good, but certainly not at the level of 2010 or 2009.	NEGATIVE	0.6461979151	0.3538020849	0.3538020849
369	369	2010	NORTHERN RHÔNE	Low yields of exceptionally good quality. One of the very best years in the northern Rhône - possibly the best in history!	POSITIVE	0.9996479154	0.0003520846367	0.9996479154
370	370	2009	NORTHERN RHÔNE	Warmer and drier than average: volumes were down and harvest was early. Ripening was quick but complete, and quality looks to be very good.	POSITIVE	0.9995978475	0.0004021525383	0.9995978475
371	371	2008	NORTHERN RHÔNE	Lots of rain gave a disappointing and dilute vintage. Some producers opted not to make their top wines at all. Largely best to avoid.	NEGATIVE	0.9983110428	0.001688957214	0.001688957214
372	372	2007	NORTHERN RHÔNE	Very wet spring, a patchy summer but the vintage was saved by decent weather in September.	POSITIVE	0.9929644465	0.007035553455	0.9929644465
373	373	2006	NORTHERN RHÔNE	Very promising. As elsewhere in France, the region experienced a very mixed August but a warm September seems to have resulted in an excitingly high success rate.	POSITIVE	0.9998341203	0.0001658797264	0.9998341203
374	374	2005	NORTHERN RHÔNE	As successful as elsewhere in France. A long term prospect which may rival 1990.	POSITIVE	0.9995241761	0.0004758238792	0.9995241761
375	375	2004	NORTHERN RHÔNE	A welcome return to normal temperatures but this post-2003 heatwave crop was not generous and wines have developed fast.	POSITIVE	0.9792299867	0.02077001333	0.9792299867
376	376	2003	NORTHERN RHÔNE	Some exceptional heatwave wines with enormous concentration and, we hope, a long and glorious life ahead.	POSITIVE	0.9998583794	0.000141620636	0.9998583794
377	377	2002	NORTHERN RHÔNE	Poor weather at flowering dramatically reduced the potential crop and paved the way for a thoroughly horrid summer resulting in rotten, unripe grapes. Some growers declassified a large proportion of them although the odd late-picked bottling may surprise. Reds should have been drunk. Good white wines though.	NEGATIVE	0.9991533756	0.0008466243744	0.0008466243744
378	378	2001	NORTHERN RHÔNE	One of the most successful regions in France in 2001. Almost as good as 1999 if more elegant and less concentrated than 2000.Very respectable levels of ripeness and good acidity and ripe tannins to support them.	POSITIVE	0.9997916222	0.0002083778381	0.9997916222
379	379	2000	NORTHERN RHÔNE	Good to very good if overshadowed by its predecessor. August was hot with heavy rain on 21 August. September enjoyed exceptionally fine weather allowing a particularly prolonged harvest. Both red and white wines are very charming.	POSITIVE	0.9998386502	0.0001613497734	0.9998386502
380	380	1999	NORTHERN RHÔNE	Exceptional quality. A sunny harvest saw good quantities of healthy grapes - a cause for real celebration in the northern Rhône. Quality is at least as good as 1998 (some compare it with 1947) and the quantity was much higher.	POSITIVE	0.9997445345	0.0002554655075	0.9997445345

397	397	2016	GERMANY	High rainfall in early summer created serious disease pressure, especially in Nahe and Mosel. What with late frost and hail, prospects for the 2016 harvest did not look good. However, the weather improved from July onwards and the overall quality is good, while the wines tend to be lower in alcohol and higher in acidity than 2015.

In the Mosel, for instance, quality is especially promising but yields were 8% down on 2014. The Rheingau is also tipped for excellence, while reds from Baden are expected to be powerful and dark.

399	399	2014	GERMANY	‘Too cold and too wet’ is the general summary for Germany in 2014. Yields were higher than the much smaller preceding vintage, but quality is surmised as 'good, bad and ugly' by Michael Schmidt, with the proviso that the better producers are inevitably the better performers.	NEGATIVE	0.9808140397	0.01918596029	0.01918596029
400	400	2013	GERMANY	A chill spring and fine, mild summer gave way to wet weather in September and October which proved many producers’ undoing. Astute vineyard management was essential to coax grapes to ripeness and avoid rot. Low yields and fair quality across the board.	NEGATIVE	0.9334925413	0.06650745869	0.06650745869
401	401	2012	GERMANY	A cool, wet summer in Germany, saved by late warmth in September and October. Yields were overall in line with long term averages, although the Mosel lost up to 25% of its crop. Quality is widely agreed to be very good indeed, and possibly the best vintage in recent memory for Spätburgunder. Dry Rieslings are excellent too, but noble sweet wines are in even smaller supply than usual.	POSITIVE	0.9995194674	0.0004805326462	0.9995194674
402	402	2011	GERMANY	Extremely good quality, with yields back at average after two more depressed years. There is palpable excitement about these wines, with top quality examples across the board from trocken Riesling and Spätburgunder and record-breaking noble whites.	POSITIVE	0.9998226166	0.0001773834229	0.9998226166
403	403	2010	GERMANY	A tricky, high-acid vintage, with low sunshine and high rain. Despite this, July was extremely hot, skewing the average temperature to well above average. Yields were devastated, but Riesling quality is nonetheless promising when in expert hands.	POSITIVE	0.9991276264	0.0008723735809	0.9991276264
404	404	2009	GERMANY	Amongst the greatest vintages, 2009 is proving very alluring at a very early stage. The growing season was dry, warm and reliable. The wines are ripe and appealing but 12% down on volume compared to 2008.	POSITIVE	0.9996638894	0.0003361105919	0.9996638894
405	405	2008	GERMANY	A very late-ripening vintage marked by cool autumn temperatures. Acidities are therefore high, and only the best-exposed sites produced truly great wines. Very few botrytis wines were made, but there was a reasonable crop of Eiswein.	POSITIVE	0.9965911508	0.003408849239	0.9965911508
406	406	2007	GERMANY	Unusual vintage during which a hot April and record early flowering was followed by a very cool summer but then the grapes were ripened, after a suitably extended growing season, by a very fine autumn. A distinct shortage of Kabinett.	NEGATIVE	0.8936398625	0.1063601375	0.1063601375
407	407	2006	GERMANY	A less than glorious summer and autumn rain bounced many growers into picking earlier than they would have liked, as rampant rot threatened. Very careful selection was needed and it is even more important than usual to stick to the top producers.	POSITIVE	0.9667310715	0.03326892853	0.9667310715
408	408	2005	GERMANY	Exceptional vintage combining the luscious fruit of 2003 with the minerality and structure of 2004. Quantities were low but, to compensate growers financially, noble rot took hold very rapidly in the autumn so that large quantities of Beerenauslese and TBA were made, of especial note in the Saar.	POSITIVE	0.9878337979	0.01216620207	0.9878337979
409	409	2004	GERMANY	Yet again autumn rescued the wines after a less than wonderful summer. Yields were relatively high but the wines have good crisp acidity and fine focus. Start drinking these around 2008.	POSITIVE	0.9996708632	0.0003291368485	0.9996708632
410	410	2003	GERMANY	Uncomfortably hot year for the Riesling vine, and even more of an assault on varieties such as Grauburgunder and Weissburgunder with their naturally lower acid levels. But some exceptional wines were made at the top of the tree.	POSITIVE	0.998323977	0.001676023006	0.998323977
411	411	2002	GERMANY	German growers were in general much happier than their French counterparts throughout the summer but many were finally caught out by rain before harvest in October which meant that very few wines above Auslese quality resulted and the rather soft wines have aged relatively rapidly.	NEGATIVE	0.9902734756	0.009726524353	0.009726524353
412	412	2001	GERMANY	A very great, long-term vintage with remarkable levels of both grape ripeness (thanks to a wonderful Indian summer) and acidity (thanks to a nerve-wrackingly wet but cool September). A high proportion of botrytised sweet wines were made - in fact there was such a shortage of basic QbA wine that considerable amounts were declassified to satisfy market demand.	POSITIVE	0.9867588282	0.01324117184	0.9867588282
413	413	2000	GERMANY	Very difficult vintage. Early optimism was finally dashed by September rains which severely compromised the health of the grapes. In many cases the earliest-picked grapes were the best because they were the least affected by rot. Early-picked Spätburgunders were relatively unscathed.	NEGATIVE	0.9927018881	0.007298111916	0.007298111916
414	414	1999	GERMANY	Everything was going so well...until the rains which began on 20 September and continued throughout the harvest. Careful selection was needed and in some cases yields were too high for real quality. Acids were generally low but some delicious wines for relatively early drinking were made by the best producers.

415	415	1998	GERMANY	Despite a wet growing season the wines showed vibrant acidity and bright fruit. Eiswein was made in some quantity.	POSITIVE	0.9997880459	0.0002119541168	0.9997880459
416	416	1997	GERMANY	Early, large crop of very attractive wines – generally clustered around Spätlese level of ripeness, although there are some lovely Mosel Auslesen.	POSITIVE	0.9981257319	0.001874268055	0.9981257319
417	417	1996	GERMANY	Attractive, lightish Mosels and southern wines with more stuffing. A very good year for Eiswein.	POSITIVE	0.9997772574	0.0002227425575	0.9997772574
418	418	1995	GERMANY	An unusually warm summer was followed by a cold, wet late August and September so that the bulk of wine produced was rather ordinary, but the late, great Riesling showed its stuff in the Mosel after a very warm October.	NEGATIVE	0.6575292349	0.3424707651	0.3424707651
419	419	1994	GERMANY	Horribly variable, but Riesling showed its class with superb quality from the good estates.	POSITIVE	0.999796629	0.000203371048	0.999796629
420	420	1993	GERMANY	A nerve-racking year. Rain hit the early harvests but patient growers picked grapes with welcome botrytis. Some fine wines still showing well.	POSITIVE	0.9994258285	0.0005741715431	0.9994258285
421	421	1992	GERMANY	Not bad, particularly in the Rhine. Estates had to control yields to overcome dilution from the rains and maintain balance.	POSITIVE	0.9880588651	0.01194113493	0.9880588651

424	424	1989	GERMANY	A phenomenal harvest. The late-harvested Rieslings show profound complexity. Probably best in the Mosel.	POSITIVE	0.9996500015	0.0003499984741	0.9996500015

427	427	2016	PIEMONTE	Piemonte produced excellent quality wine in 2016, with ripeness to match the very good 2015 but firmer tannin and higher acidity. Ideal harvest conditions allowed the Nebbiolo to ripen fully, and yields were higher than average too. Arneis also fared well, producing precise, juicy white wines.	POSITIVE	0.9996823668	0.000317633152	0.9996823668
428	428	2015	PIEMONTE	An exceptional vintage thanks to healthy grapes and exceptionally regular bunches. A very cold winter with plenty of snow and a protracted cool and rainy spring replenished the water tables, much needed during a July that was the hottest ever on record. The vintage shows great promise, even if some grapes were relatively low in acidity.	POSITIVE	0.9997853637	0.0002146363258	0.9997853637
429	429	2014	PIEMONTE	The second year in a row when a wet, cool spring followed a very wet winter. Mid May saw temperatures soar, resulting in a regular and quick fruit set that seemed to promise an early harvest and generous yield. But the weather changed to cool and very wet from early July with some violent hailstorms, notably in the commune of Barolo, dashing all hopes of a great vintage. Quality is expected to be irregular, but those who dared to delay harvest were rewarded with a sound, if notably small, crop of Nebbiolo. Likely to be a light year with limited cellaring potential.	NEGATIVE	0.9288806319	0.07111936808	0.07111936808
430	430	2013	PIEMONTE	Incessant rain during winter and spring delayed budbreak and opened the door to fungal diseases, although many vineyards were too waterlogged for tractors. From mid July temperatures shot up and remained high during August, albeit with cooler nights. September was very sunny and dry, but the growing cycle was still two weeks late, necessitating a delayed harvest. The prognosis is for a vintage similar in quality to the already legendary 2010s.	NEGATIVE	0.9049859047	0.09501409531	0.09501409531
431	431	2012	PIEMONTE	An unusually hot summer unexpectedly resulted in Nebbiolos with low alcohol levels and high acidity. A very cold February with an abundance of snow helped to replenish water tables. Prolonged cool weather, well into April, protracted budbreak by two weeks. The weather became more regular, with a warm July, only to be interrupted by several hailstorms destroying the crop in several vineyards in Novello. August turned out to be exceptionally hot with temperatures rising well above 40 ºC, causing vines to shut down and halting the growing cycle. Rain at the end of August cooled things down and restarted (slow) ripening. A dry autumn allowed a delayed harvest. The best wines show acidic nerve, balance and freshness. Overall a light vintage but with several excellent wines on the top level.	NEGATIVE	0.903098166	0.09690183401	0.09690183401
432	432	2011	PIEMONTE	A very hot year which has nevertheless resulted in some very good, supple, ripe but not stewed wines, even if at times the higher alcohol (15% and sometimes more) make some of them unbalanced. A very warm April set expectations for a harvest a full four weeks earlier than usual. A distinctly cool June and July slowed the growing cycle down considerably, but August was so hot that Dolcetto raisined on the vine. Rain at the beginning of September accelerated ripening again. Cool nights saved Nebbiolo from overripeness, yet harvest was still a full two weeks earlier than the norm.	POSITIVE	0.8104524016	0.1895475984	0.8104524016
433	433	2010	PIEMONTE	A wet spring caused irregular fruit set and was followed by an early summer with lots of rain. While Dolcetto suffered most from the short, cool growing season, Nebbiolo proved resilient thanks to its small berries and thick skins. August proved hot, but cool nights helped retain acidity. Some cooling rain in early September ensured a slow but steady development in the berries. Irregular fruit set meant that some producers had to do a severe selection during harvest, but the overall result is considered outstanding: a classic vintage with plenty of acidity, firm but ripe tannins and near-perfect balance in many wines.	POSITIVE	0.9995741844	0.0004258155823	0.9995741844
434	434	2009	PIEMONTE	A cold winter with lots of rain and snow delayed the start of the growing cycle. An unusually warm spring, however, encouraged a rapid budbreak and regular fruit set. It was still warm in June but a wet July increased fungal pressure in the vineyards and reduced yields in some cases. August was extremely hot and dry and the weather remained like this until mid September. The lack of rain caused water stress and vines to shut down. All this let to wildly irregular weather patterns throughout the region with some Barbera being picked before the early-ripening Dolcetto. Malic acid levels were overall below average, while the tannins did not always ripen fully. Quality is irregular, with excellence next to mediocrity, but hardly any of the wines show the stewed and dried-fruit flavours of the equally torrid 2003 vintage.	NEGATIVE	0.9972047806	0.002795219421	0.002795219421
435	435	2008	PIEMONTE	Overshadowed by the plush 2007 wines from a hot vintage, 2008’s austerity was not immediately recognised as the stuff great vintages are made of. Although not without challenges to the growers, a long and cool growing cycle resulted in healthy, thick-skinned Nebbiolo grapes full of extract and high sugar levels, balanced by great acidity. Although in most cases the tannins are still unyielding, these powerful wines have all the ingredients for a significant gain in complexity and depth over years to come.	POSITIVE	0.9982812405	0.001718759537	0.9982812405
436	436	2007	PIEMONTE	Hail and arid conditions resulted in a low-yielding year, but of good quality fruit.	POSITIVE	0.9983690381	0.001630961895	0.9983690381
437	437	2006	PIEMONTE	A coolish summer was followed by an Indian summer punctuated by two bouts of rain but the grapes were healthy enough to withstand them. Promising.	POSITIVE	0.999540627	0.0004593729973	0.999540627
438	438	2005	PIEMONTE	Reduced crop of decent but unremarkable wines for medium term drinking.	NEGATIVE	0.9902846813	0.00971531868	0.00971531868
439	439	2004	PIEMONTE	Very promising with few extremes of weather and well balanced wines.	POSITIVE	0.9998333454	0.0001666545868	0.9998333454
440	440	2003	PIEMONTE	As elsewhere, the heatwave shrivelled grapes and resulted in some unbalanced musts although the oldest vines in Barolo and Barbaresco managed to withstand the weather and yield some exceptional wines.	NEGATIVE	0.9707763791	0.02922362089	0.02922362089
441	441	2002	PIEMONTE	Piemonte's run of good to great vintages was finally broken with disastrous hail in parts of Barolo, rot, unripeness and unusually cool weather. The thin-skinned Barbera suffered most in this small vintage.	NEGATIVE	0.9993021488	0.000697851181	0.000697851181
442	442	2001	PIEMONTE	Excellent quality (and quantity) from an early vintage slightly more in the voluptuous mould of 1999 and 1997 than particularly long-term. No shortage of ripeness or structure, but an occasional shortage of acidity.	POSITIVE	0.9980638623	0.001936137676	0.9980638623
443	443	2000	PIEMONTE	Very good, partly thanks to a prolonged heatwave from mid-August to mid-September. Dolcettos were relatively simple but both Barbera and, especially, Nebbiolo were exceptional with excellent acidity as well as ripeness and great definition of flavour. For the long term.	POSITIVE	0.9998152256	0.0001847743988	0.9998152256
444	444	1999	PIEMONTE	Very good quality yet again for Nebbiolo-based wines, and Dolcetto which was much more successful than the later-ripening Barbera. Voluptuous Barolo and Barbaresco recalls 1997.	POSITIVE	0.9996822476	0.0003177523613	0.9996822476

460	460	2016	TUSCANY	Another good vintage in Tuscany has produced wines with deep colour and impressive fragrance. However, yields were down by up to a fifth compared to the average. Chianti Classico enjoyed particularly good quality fruit.	POSITIVE	0.9997029305	0.0002970695496	0.9997029305
461	461	2015	TUSCANY	A cold and rainy winter preceded an irregular spring followed by exceptionally hot, dry summer weather, creating small bunches of Sangiovese, so yields were down across the region – exacerbated by several violent August hailstorms – although concentration levels are very good.	NEGATIVE	0.7529616952	0.2470383048	0.2470383048
462	462	2014	TUSCANY	A rainy, mild winter was followed by a cool spring, with one exceptional patch of high temperatures causing early budbreak and quick and generous fruit set. But the growing cycle was protracted due to cool weather and frequent hailstorms in July and August, causing widespread downy mildew. An exceptionally mild and dry September and early October turned a potentially disastrous vintage into a surprisingly good one, but with generally much lighter, earlier-ripening wines than 2013.	POSITIVE	0.9523648024	0.04763519764	0.9523648024
463	463	2013	TUSCANY	Considered a ‘classic vintage’ due to harvest taking place at the beginning of October. (This used to be the norm but the previous two, much warmer, years brought harvests forward to the beginning of September.) A very cool wet spring delayed budbreak by an average of two weeks. A very wet May that encouraged widespread and continued spraying was followed by a cool June. A picture-perfect July, August and September saved the year, one that resulted in elegant, fresh wines. A promising vintage on the whole, with the wines of Montalcino expected to be exceptional.	POSITIVE	0.9996659756	0.0003340244293	0.9996659756
464	464	2012	TUSCANY	An unusually mild winter ended with a very cold February with lots of snow that replenished water tables. Spring was more or less regular with a warm and dry June, while temperatures climbed relentlessly during July and August. Just when producers feared a repeat of the scorching 2011, and vines had but all shut down, the rain that fell at the very end of August reignited growth and ripening. In spite of the intense heat, 2012 resulted in medium-bodied, fresh and at times rather light wines, arguably a welcome change from the heavy and sometimes alcoholic 2011s.	POSITIVE	0.9989625216	0.001037478447	0.9989625216
465	465	2011	TUSCANY	An exceptionally hot vintage with a very irregular weather pattern. A very cold and snowy winter preceded an unusually warm beginning of spring, although budbreak was not much earlier than normal. April was very hot, followed by a cool May. This pattern of alternating cold and hot periods had a ‘stop-go’ effect on the growth of the vines. The middle of August brought record-breaking heat and the grapes seemed prematurely ready, with some producers picking at the end of August to rescue the fruit from the burning sun. September remained extremely warm and 2011 was the year in which the sorting table arrived en masse in Chianti Classico. Many wines are rich, but fortunately still have enough freshness, although it is doubtful that this will remain during prolonged bottle ageing.	POSITIVE	0.9938129783	0.006187021732	0.9938129783
466	466	2010	TUSCANY	Much cooler than the hot 2009. A very wet winter continuing into a very wet spring was followed by a cool growing cycle. The heat that came in July helped to reduce the delay in ripening that was by then an estimated 15 days behind schedule. Sangiovese was harvested as late as the third week of October and many producers had to do several pickings to obtain regularly ripe grapes in the fermentation tanks. Montalcino, exceptionally, was drier than other parts of Tuscany and the long and slow ripening of the grapes resulted in what is considered an outstanding vintage with true ageing potential for years to come.	POSITIVE	0.995511651	0.004488348961	0.995511651
467	467	2009	TUSCANY	Initially hailed as a great vintage but the wines, rich and at times jammy with high alcohol, have begun to betray the exceptionally hot summer as they develop in bottle. A very wet winter was followed by a regular spring with a very hot May, with temperatures up to 30 ºC, resulting in a swift flowering and fruit set. The vintage looked to be 10 days earlier than normal, until mid May brought 30 solid days of rain. August was extremely hot with day temperatures reaching 40 ºC, although nights were much cooler than in 2003, which helped to preserve the freshness in the grapes. While the 2009s overall showed richness of fruit with good acidity, in many cases a certain jamminess looks likely to affect their ageing ability.	POSITIVE	0.9917783141	0.008221685886	0.9917783141
468	468	2008	TUSCANY	A relatively cool year with high diurnal temperature differences resulting in wines generally high in acidity and with firm tannins. The heterogeneity of finished wines suggests that this is a vintage in which the best terroirs shine. This seems to be true of Chianti Classico too, where the 2007s were initially considered greater. However, the best 2008s, especially the truly serious Riservas, should prove to have complexity as well staying power.	POSITIVE	0.9993470907	0.0006529092789	0.9993470907
469	469	2007	TUSCANY	Tremendous: high alcohol and good acidity with consistent ripening, after a worryingly erratic budburst. Especially good for Chianti and Montalcino, and for Cabernet Sauvignon in Bolgheri.	POSITIVE	0.999774754	0.0002252459526	0.999774754

476	476	2000	TUSCANY	Easy, ripe wines from a very hot, dry vintage which, unless vineyards were extremely well-managed, resulted in wines with a certain hollowness, though no shortage of alcohol.	NEGATIVE	0.9226833582	0.07731664181	0.07731664181
477	477	1999	TUSCANY	Quite exceptionally good quality. A vintage not unlike 1997 but with arguably more finesse and less sheer mass. Warm summer led to an early harvest of healthy grapes.	POSITIVE	0.9996081591	0.0003918409348	0.9996081591

491	491	2016	NEW ZEALAND	A welcome increase of volume produced after the small 2015 vintage. Martinborough had excellent weather conditions throughout the year, and is likely to fare better than Central Otago. In Marlborough, larger than average berry size is expected to emphasise thiols (passionfruit flavours) over methoxypyrazines (herbal flavours).	POSITIVE	0.9995393157	0.0004606842995	0.9995393157
492	492	2015	NEW ZEALAND	Marlborough enjoyed a very dry summer, resulting in wines with greater concentration than 2014 and yields were down 20-25%. Central Otago enjoyed plenty of ripeness in the Pinot Noir.	NEGATIVE	0.7976379395	0.2023620605	0.2023620605
493	493	2014	NEW ZEALAND	A generally good vintage across the country, with particular excitement in Hawke’s Bay where 2014 is thought of as potentially even better than the outstanding 2013. The country’s viticultural engine room Marlborough had its largest ever vintage, with quality touted as above-average.	POSITIVE	0.9997903109	0.0002096891403	0.9997903109
494	494	2013	NEW ZEALAND	Slightly riper than 2012 in Marlborough, and 'nigh-on perfect' in much of the north island, especially Hawke's Bay, with a long, warm summer and no adverse weather - although early frosts did bring down yields for many.	POSITIVE	0.9996225238	0.0003774762154	0.9996225238
495	495	2012	NEW ZEALAND	One of the coolest years on record, and an overall yield 18% below the norm. This resulted in Sauvignon Blancs with grass and citrus flavours instead of tropical fruit.	POSITIVE	0.9632643461	0.03673565388	0.9632643461

508	508	2016	PORT AND THE DOURO	A cold and wet spring made for a tough start to the year, and yields were lower than average as a result. Some very hot spells followed, retarding the ripening process as the vines shut down. Thankfully, the autumn was mostly dry, allowing for a long harvest to ensure optimum ripeness and the wines are rich, complex and intense.	POSITIVE	0.9903131723	0.00968682766	0.9903131723
509	509	2015	PORT AND THE DOURO	Overall, a dry and warm year in the Douro, but with enough rainfall at the right times to keep the vines in good condition. Disease pressure was low and the harvest was earlier than average. Flavour ripeness is impressive across all varieties, but acidity levels are fairly low, as are yields. Most producers are confident of making great vintage ports in this vintage.	POSITIVE	0.9965573549	0.003442645073	0.9965573549
510	510	2014	PORT AND THE DOURO	Rain caused significant damage in the first half of the year, then a cool August didn’t help matters. Yields will be low, quality is not remarkable, and vintage declarations are most unlikely.	NEGATIVE	0.9484511018	0.05154889822	0.05154889822
511	511	2013	PORT AND THE DOURO	Unusually cool conditions in April and May and a tinder dry summer slowed grape development resulting in a low-yielding, tardy harvest of generally high quality.	NEGATIVE	0.9861986041	0.01380139589	0.01380139589
512	512	2012	PORT AND THE DOURO	The Douro saw drought and hail conspire to reduce yields significantly, by as much as 40% in places. The resultant small berries have made wines of high colour and notable acidity.	POSITIVE	0.9980154634	0.001984536648	0.9980154634
513	513	2011	PORT AND THE DOURO	The rain of 2010 was crucial in this much drier year, to sustain the vines through a hot summer. There was, finally, much needed precipitation in late August and September with dry, warm conditions thereafter which were perfect for picking. Looks to be a great quality vintage.

514	514	2010	PORT AND THE DOURO	An exceptionally wet winter brought challenging erosion to the Douro, but welcome restoration of ground water.

515	515	2009	PORT AND THE DOURO	An exceptionally hot summer led to an early vintage with great potential for Port, but extremely high alcohols in the unfortified wines, with some unripe tannins and shrivelled berries. Higher altitude sites will be crucial to making these wines work. A declared vintage.	POSITIVE	0.99648875	0.003511250019	0.99648875
516	516	2008	PORT AND THE DOURO	A dry but, like 2007, cool year. Some growers picked early for fear of rain, but those that risked it were rewarded with ideal ripening conditions late in the season.

517	517	2007	PORT AND THE DOURO	A vintage year, and one that has produced exceptionally approachable Ports at a young age.

522	522	2002	PORT AND THE DOURO	The usual very dry summer was followed by an unusually wet September which compromised both the health and ripeness of those grapes that were picked.

523	523	2001	PORT AND THE DOURO	Some very good vintage port. Exceptionally wet winter - an unprecedented five months of rain - was followed by early budburst slowed by a cool spring. The crop was reduced by a heatwave in June but conditions were favourable throughout the rest of the summer. Useful quantity with good not great quality.

524	524	2000	PORT AND THE DOURO	Mild and exceptionally dry winter was followed by a wet spring which delayed the growth cycle. An unusually hot September gave the grapes a late boost just before harvest in benign conditions. The result of this, together with the introduction of new, mechanised alternatives to foot-treading in some houses, is a range of particularly luscious, ripe vintage ports.

558	558	2001	SOUTH AFRICA	Continued the run of hot vintages, and produced a very small harvest of concentrated reds. Tannins were generally softer than in 2000.	POSITIVE	0.9916754961	0.008324503899	0.9916754961
559	559	2000	SOUTH AFRICA	The third hot year in a row. Whites were unimpressive, but reds were powerful and concentrated, with high tannic structure.	POSITIVE	0.9983972311	0.001602768898	0.9983972311
560	560	2016	CATALUNYA	Drought conditions throughout the year led to low yields across Catalunya. The small berries have resulted in very high intensity, with local grape varieties generally performing better than international varieties. Quality is good, even if yields were not.

561	561	2015	CATALUNYA	Priorat and Montsant escaped the harvest rains unscathed in 2015, and producers are very enthused about the quality. Potentially the best harvest of the last five years.	POSITIVE	0.9997564554	0.0002435445786	0.9997564554
562	562	2014	CATALUNYA	Quite a lot of rot at harvest due to humid conditions. Together with modest temperatures throughout the summer, this is a lighter and fresher vintage – especially when compared with the more typically full 2013s.	POSITIVE	0.999191463	0.0008085370064	0.999191463
563	563	2013	CATALUNYA	Very healthy fruit at harvest, with lots of promise across the varieties. Good quality, and higher yields than in 2012.	POSITIVE	0.9998714328	0.0001285672188	0.9998714328
564	564	2012	CATALUNYA	Greater elegance than 2011, with Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon thriving in the warm, dry conditions. Yields were down by up to 25% in some areas, however.	POSITIVE	0.9895457029	0.01045429707	0.9895457029
565	565	2011	CATALUNYA	Very hot throughout August and September, creating some dehydration. Immensely powerful wines with a great deal of flesh.	POSITIVE	0.9998360872	0.0001639127731	0.9998360872
566	566	2010	CATALUNYA	Hot in early summer, becoming cooler toward the end, allowing slow and gradual ripening into autumn. Alcohol levels are rather lower than usual. Reds are better than whites.	POSITIVE	0.8561610579	0.1438389421	0.8561610579
567	567	2016	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	Unlike Catalunya, Rioja enjoyed an abundant harvest – the largest since 2005, and many producers had to discard fruit to meet the permitted yield. Quality is excellent, with modest alcohol, full ripeness, relatively light tannins, good aromatic range and no bitterness. In Ribera del Duero, the outlook is also positive, with quality as good as the strong 2015 vintage.	POSITIVE	0.9998357892	0.0001642107964	0.9998357892
568	568	2015	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	Ribera was hot and dry in 2015. Old vines did well while younger vines struggled. Volume was lower than in 2014 by up to one third. Low nitrogen levels led to some struggling ferments, but the flavour ripeness is very high, with soft tannins and high potential alcohol. Alcohol will also be higher than usual in Rioja, again with powerful concentration and richness. A short, early harvest reflected the ripeness of the crop. Berries were small across the region, with the higher, cooler vineyards of Rioja showing especially high quality.	POSITIVE	0.9992790222	0.0007209777832	0.9992790222
569	569	2014	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	The official report from Rioja describes the 2014 harvest as improved in quality and quantity compared to 2013, though they acknowledge some grey rot affected the final week of harvest.	POSITIVE	0.9817412496	0.01825875044	0.9817412496
570	570	2013	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	Despite a cool, wet start to the year, a long dry summer in Ribera del Duero heralded full fruit ripeness at harvest, with below average temperatures promising fine flavour development. Frequent bouts of wet weather in Rioja, together with the cold spring, resulted in some uneven ripening and a delayed harvest that slipped into November in some parts, yet yields here were slightly up on 2012 and producers are optimistic.	POSITIVE	0.9981197715	0.001880228519	0.9981197715
571	571	2012	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	A weird year of weather in Spain. It was the fifth consecutive small vintage, thanks in large part to very dry conditions. The resultant small berries harvested in Rioja are likely to make wines of great concentration and high tannin. The Ribera del Duero crop was also shrunk by drought but producers there are a little more optimistic about eventual quality.	POSITIVE	0.9877735972	0.01222640276	0.9877735972
572	572	2011	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	Hot and heat-stressed for the vines in Rioja with lower acidity than average but powerful, concentrated wines of good quality.

573	573	2010	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	Exceptional for Ribera del Duero with no excessive weather patterns, uniform ripeness and quality as promising as 2004. Good quality in Rioja also, considered better than 2009.	POSITIVE	0.9997886419	0.0002113580704	0.9997886419
574	574	2009	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	Very hot conditions gave average temperatures above the infamous 2003 vintage. However, timely rains in Rioja and Ribera del Duero relieved the vines and rescued the vintage. Very good quality.	POSITIVE	0.9998016357	0.0001983642578	0.9998016357
575	575	2008	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	Very good quality for Rioja, with favourable weather throughout autumn. In Ribera del Duero, temperatures were cooler than normal, giving a slow, balanced ripening process and elegant wines as a result.	POSITIVE	0.99982059	0.0001794099808	0.99982059
576	576	2007	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	After a miserable summer, frost on 24 September decimated the crop from many young Ribera del Duero vineyards. Most grapes struggled to ripen but late pickers were rewarded. Not a stellar year though.	NEGATIVE	0.9841609597	0.01583904028	0.01583904028

581	581	2002	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	Exceptionally cold winter and spring was followed by nasty wet weather during summer - disastrous for both quality and quantity. Rain persisted even during harvest. Truly a severe test for both regions.	NEGATIVE	0.99936378	0.0006362199783	0.0006362199783
582	582	2001	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	Smaller-than-usual crop because of spring frosts but distinctly superior quality accentuated in some cases by further deliberate crop thinning. Some very fine wines.	POSITIVE	0.9962026477	0.003797352314	0.9962026477
583	583	2000	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	Record crop levels and extremely variable quality with exceptionally high summer temperatures and in many cases a lack of concentration. Some very good wines from Ribera del Duero though.	POSITIVE	0.5816595554	0.4183404446	0.5816595554
584	584	1999	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	April frost in Rioja delayed ripening of grapes that suffered thanks to summer rains. Better quality in Ribera del Duero, however, although harvest rain reduced acidity. Good quality but not quite as good as	NEGATIVE	0.9615089297	0.03849107027	0.03849107027
585	585	1998	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	Despite spring frosts, yields were still too high to ripen some grapes sufficiently in Ribera del Duero. Quantity was also Rioja’s strong suit.	NEGATIVE	0.5020874739	0.4979125261	0.4979125261

588	588	1995	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	Another frost-shrunk crop in Ribera del Duero, although the grapes were riper and probably better balanced than in 1994. Rioja's bodegas, on the other hand, were swollen by an enormous harvest of ripe, healthy grapes.	POSITIVE	0.7554046512	0.2445953488	0.7554046512
589	589	1994	RIOJA AND RIBERA DEL DUERO	Quality isn't a problem but quantity is after spring frosts and summer drought. Some very nice wines indeed.	POSITIVE	0.9993762374	0.0006237626076	0.9993762374

597	597	2017	ENGLAND	Better yields than in 2016, though frost damage affected many vineyards in the south-east of England. Sugar levels were good at harvest, thanks to some hot spells in June and a mostly dry harvest period, and acid levels were mostly well-balanced too. Total harvest 4.5 m bottles off 2,275 hectares.	POSITIVE	0.997633636	0.002366364002	0.997633636
598	598	2016	ENGLAND	Very low yields made things difficult for many producers, but quality was at least generally good. The eastern part of England had the better weather, and ripeness reached record levels in many cases. Total harvest 4.15 m bottles off 2,100 hectares.	POSITIVE	0.9990913272	0.0009086728096	0.9990913272
599	599	2015	ENGLAND	A frost-free spring led to a cool spring. Flowering weather was very good, but two weeks late, and with a cool summer, characterised by untypical cool nights, grapes were slow to develop. August and most of September were cooler than average and many growers were despairing of harvesting later varieties. However, a good end to September and an exceptionally warm October saved growers and most picked good yields of healthy grapes. Altogether a very good year for both still and sparkling wines, although Chardonnay based sparkling wines will want long ageing. Total harvest estimated to be 4.5 m bottles off 1,600 hectares.	POSITIVE	0.9961700439	0.003829956055	0.9961700439
600	600	2014	ENGLAND	A dream year for UK vineyards with little frost, very good flowering weather, a cool wet August, but warm September and October. Most growers had very good crops with excellent sugars and acids. Still wines very good and sparklers up to the high quality of 2009. Total harvest 6.32 m bottles off 1,506 hectares.	POSITIVE	0.999786973	0.0002130270004	0.999786973
601	601	2013	ENGLAND	An early frost-free spring then led to a cool spell with very good, but very late, flowering weather. Grapes developed slowly with one of the latest harvests on record in modern times. Some growers still picking in mid-November. Not a great year for still wines and sparklers will be long-lived. Total harvest 4.45 m bottles off 1,571 hectares.	NEGATIVE	0.9702828526	0.02971714735	0.02971714735
602	602	2012	ENGLAND	A year best forgotten for many growers. Really bad flowering weather and high disease pressures saw some growers (but by no means all) pick nothing. However, those wines that were produced are of good quality. Total yield 1.03 m bottles off 1,297 hectares. Lowest average yield ever recorded.	POSITIVE	0.9806544185	0.01934558153	0.9806544185
603	603	2011	ENGLAND	Poor flowering with widespread _millerandage_ especially on Pinots saw some growers struggling. Fair quality, but not the greatest. Total vintage 3.02 m bottles off 1,208 hectares.	NEGATIVE	0.9968987107	0.003101289272	0.003101289272
604	604	2010	ENGLAND	Ideal flowering conditions and a warm summer saw another early harvest with some growers having to pick Pinots early as sugars were getting too high. A very good year for both still and sparkling wines. Total vintage 4.05 m bottles off 1,095 hectares.	POSITIVE	0.9997057915	0.0002942085266	0.9997057915
605	605	2009	ENGLAND	Very little spring frost, perfect flowering weather, rain at the right time and warm dry weather at the end of the season resulted in an early harvest with high sugars and balanced acids. Great year for both still and sparkling wines. Total vintage 3.18 m bottles off 946 hectares.	POSITIVE	0.9997087717	0.0002912282944	0.9997087717
606	606	2016	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	While Europe suffered from frost and hail, northern California experienced very heavy rainfall in autumn 2016. While that partially relieved the extended drought status of the region, it also caused some flood damage. Cooler than normal temperatures in August allowed for a steady, gradual ripening, which has produced wines of very good complexity, and higher-than-average natural acidity.	POSITIVE	0.9991371632	0.0008628368378	0.9991371632
607	607	2015	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	In common with much of Europe, the harvest started early in California – as early as July for some growers of sparkling wine. Yields are almost universally down on 2014. Huge wildfires proved a challenge for many, causing damage to vineyards and property as well as threatening smoke taint, especially in Lake County.

608	608	2014	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	Drought made itself felt in Napa and Sonoma, but ample ripeness led to a relatively early harvest of grapes in good condition and with plenty of flavour. There is a general sense of positivity across most regions and varieties for the potential quality of 2014 in California.	POSITIVE	0.9996985197	0.0003014802933	0.9996985197

610	610	2012	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	A banner year, providing a useful exception to the short crops experienced so widely elsewhere. Ideal growing conditions seem likely to have produced the best vintage for decades. Virtually all varieties seem to have thrived. Quality with quantity at last.

611	611	2011	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	Miserable conditions made for a very challenging harvest, with mildew and botrytis rife in Napa and Sonoma. Volumes are therefore low for the second consecutive year, with the best quality only found where growers managed to pick ripe fruit before the rainstorms in October.

612	612	2010	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	A very cool start to the season, then sudden heat in August followed by torrential rain.

615	615	2007	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	Harvest began early, mid August in the warmer regions, then a cool September slowed ripening to a crawl, allowing physiological maturity to catch up with sugars. October warmed up, and most had their grapes in before late-October rains. Elegant, balanced wines. Yields down 15 to 25%.	POSITIVE	0.8653501868	0.1346498132	0.8653501868
616	616	2006	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	An unusually cool, wet growing season forced growers to drop substantial quantities of rotten fruit and pushed the harvest back to November.

620	620	2002	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	Summer started cool and continued very dry - quite exceptionally dry - so that the ripening process simply stopped and growers had to bite their nails through September waiting for anything like ideal ripeness. As in Europe, a difficult vintage, but for very different reasons.	NEGATIVE	0.9811977744	0.01880222559	0.01880222559
621	621	2001	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	A respite for growers plagued by unusual conditions in both 2000 and 2002 with most varieties ripening evenly when expected, although some Cabernet vines shut down in August. A coolish September was a boon.	POSITIVE	0.9956556559	0.004344344139	0.9956556559
622	622	2000	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	Long, late, 'European' vintage thanks to an unusually cool, wet summer. There were very real concerns that Cabernet Sauvignon would never ripen in some vineyards.

623	623	1999	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	Very late, dry, cool growing season which depended crucially on ripeness being boosted by a late September heatwave. A late rush resulted in many varieties ripening simultaneously leading to a short, extremely pressurised harvest. Some luscious Cabernets were made as a result of the relatively new preoccupation with extended 'hang time'.	NEGATIVE	0.9486573339	0.05134266615	0.05134266615
624	624	1998	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	The cliffhanger vintage that was as late as 1997 was early. Wines tend to lack stuffing, although some Cabernets took on surprising charm after 10 years in bottle.	NEGATIVE	0.9451701045	0.0548298955	0.0548298955

626	626	1996	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	Small crop of relatively lightweight wines, most of which should probably have been drunk.	NEGATIVE	0.9931128621	0.00688713789	0.00688713789
627	627	1995	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	Yet another region in which a warm, dry autumn and late harvest saved the day after a difficult growing season. Reds, especially Zinfandels, may be even better than 1991. Small quantities pushed up prices, however.	POSITIVE	0.980766356	0.01923364401	0.980766356
628	628	1994	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	Generally compared to 1991, the slow ripening benefited the reds especially.	POSITIVE	0.9994670749	0.0005329251289	0.9994670749
629	629	1993	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	Erratic growing conditions reduced eventual yields. A mixed bag.	NEGATIVE	0.9997964501	0.0002035498619	0.0002035498619
630	630	1992	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	Plenty of good reds and whites, with Merlot, then increasingly fashionable, a highlight.	POSITIVE	0.9998502135	0.0001497864723	0.9998502135
631	631	1991	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	A long growing season reflected in unusually fragrant, complex wines, with Zinfandel strong.	POSITIVE	0.9998244047	0.0001755952835	0.9998244047
632	632	1990	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	A modest-sized crop, the top Cabernets and Chardonnays rivalled 1985.	POSITIVE	0.9997501373	0.0002498626709	0.9997501373
633	633	1989	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	After autumn rains, poorly drained sites suffered, and many picked too early. Variable, especially the whites.	NEGATIVE	0.9982712865	0.001728713512	0.001728713512
634	634	1988	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	A cooler summer yielded light, charming, early-maturing wines.	POSITIVE	0.9998648763	0.0001351237297	0.9998648763
635	635	1987	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	A mixed year, but marvellous Zinfandels and Cabernets.	POSITIVE	0.9993394613	0.0006605386734	0.9993394613
636	636	1986	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	Only slightly inferior to 1985 and successful for all varieties.	POSITIVE	0.9977684617	0.002231538296	0.9977684617
637	637	1985	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	Outstanding: elegant and stylish with the balance to age well.	POSITIVE	0.9998846054	0.0001153945923	0.9998846054
638	638	1984	NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	A very hot year, the whites faded long ago but you can still find the odd lovely decadent red.	POSITIVE	0.9990776181	0.0009223818779	0.9990776181
